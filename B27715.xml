            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READERS.</head>
            <p>SOME brief Account of the Occasion and design of the ensuing Discourse, I judg due unto the <hi>Reader,</hi> that upon a prospect of them, he may either proceed in its perusal, or desist as he shall see cause.</p>
            <p>That the state of Religion is at this day deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in most parts of the Christian World, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all, who concern themselves in any thing that is so called. Yea the Enormities of some are come to that excess that others publickly complain of them, who without the Countenance of their more bold Provocations would themselves be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no small part or cause of the Evils to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of. However this on all hands will as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose be agreed unto, that among the generality of professed Christians, the Glory and Power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity are faded and almost utterly lost; though the Reasons and Causes thereof are not agreed upon. For however some few may please themselves, in supposing nothing to be wanting unto a good state of things in Religion, but only security in what they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:204232:4"/> are and enjoy, yet the whole World is so evidently filled with the dreadful effects of the Lusts of men, and sad tokens of Divine Dispeasure, that all things from above and here below, proclaim the Degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Religion in its profession, from its Pristine Beauty and Glory. Religion is the same that ever it was, only it suffers by them that make Profession of it. Whatever disadvantage it falls under in the World, they must at length answer for, in whose misbelief and practice it is corrupted. And no man can express a greater enmity unto, or malice against the Gospel, than he that should assert or maintain, that the Faith, Profession, Lives, Ways and Walkings of the generality of Christians are a just Representation of its Truth and Holiness. The description, which the Apostle gives of men in their principles, dispositions and actings, before there hath been any effectual influences on their minds and lives from the Light, Power, and Grace of the Gospel, is much more applicable unto them, than any thing that is spoken of the Disciples of Christ in the whole book of God. <hi>Foolish are they, &amp; disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, deceived, serving divers Lusts and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, living in Malice and Envy, hateful and hating one another.</hi> The way, paths and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of Gospel-Faith, Love, Meekness, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Selfdenyal, Benignity, Humility, Zeal and Contempt of the World, in the Honours, Profits
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204232:4"/> and Pleasures of it, with readiness for the Cross, are all overgrown, and almost worn out amongst men, that they can hardly be discerned where they have been. But in their stead the works of the fllesh have made a broad and open Road that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude travel in; which though it may be right for a season in their own Eyes, yet is it the way to Hell, and goeth down to the Chambers of Death. For these works of the flesh are manifest in the World, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their nature what they are, but in their open perpetration and dismal effects; such are <hi>Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanness, Lasciviousness, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Witchceraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Strife, Seditions, Heresies, Envyings, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Drunkeness, Revellings, and such-like,</hi> as they are reckoned up by the Apostle. How these things have spread themselves over the face of the Christian World among all sorts of persons, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest beyond all contradiction or pretence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And that so it should come to pass in the <hi>later times</hi> is both expresly and frequently foretold in the Scripture, as in the ensuing discourse will be more fully declared.</p>
            <p>Many indeed there are who are not given up in the course of their lives unto the open practice of such A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations. And therefore in that grand Defection from the Truth and Holiness of the Gospel which is so provalent in the World, The Grace of God is greatly to be admired, even in the small remainders
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:204232:5"/> of Piety, Sobriety, and Modesty, and common Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness that are yet left among us. But those openly flagitious courses are not the only way whereby men may fall of from, and even renounce the Power Grace and Wisdon of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>For even of those, who will not run out into the same excess of riot with other men, the most are so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Mysteries of the Gospel, so negligent or formal in divine Worship, so infected with Pride, Vanity and Love of the World, so regardless of the Glory of Christ, and Honour of the Gospel, that it is no easie thing to find Christian Religion in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of professed Christians, or the Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness among them who openly avow the Forme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>By this means is Christianity brought into so great neglect in the World, that its great and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Adversarie seems encouraged to attempt the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining of its very foundations, that the name of it should no more be had in remembrance. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Religion is taken of from a solid consistency by its Power in the lives and minds of men, when it hath no other Tenure but an outward unenlivened Profession, and the secular interest of it Professors, it will not long abide the shock of that Opposition which it is continually exposed unto. And whilst things are in this state, those, who seem to have any concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein, are so ingaged in mutual charging one another with being Occasions thereof, mostly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:204232:5"/> on such Principles of Difference in Judgment as have no considerable influence thereinto, as that a joynt endeavour after proper Remedies is utterly neglected.</p>
            <p>And there is yet another Consideration rendring the present state of Christian Religion in the World yet more deplorable. The only Principle of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience is sacred Truth, and our Faith therein. That alone is the <hi>Doctrine which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Godliness,</hi> and all acceptable Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto God is the <hi>Obedience of Faith.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men do or pretend unto in a way of Duty unto him, whereof the Truth of the Gospel is not the spring and measure, which is not guided and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated thereby, it is not what God at present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, nor what he will eternally reward. Wherefore although men may, and multitudes do, under a profession of that Truth live in open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against its Power; yet the wounds of Religion are not incurable, nor its stains indelible, whilst the proper Remedy is owned, &amp; wants only due Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if this Truth it self be corrupted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, if its most glorious Mysteries be abused or despised, and if its most important Doctrines be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached of Error and False-hood, if the vain Imaginations and carnal Reasonings of the serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine wits of men be substituted in their Room, or exalted above them, what hope is there of a Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very? the breach will grow like the Sea, until there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204232:6"/> be none to heal it. If the fountaines of the Waters of the Sanctuary be poisoned in their first rising, they will not heal the Nations unto whom they come. Where the Doctrine of Truth is corrupted, the hearts of men will not be changed by it, nor their lives reformed.</p>
            <p>How all this hath come to pass in the Apostacy of the Roman Church, and what Multitudes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christians are carryed down the Stream of that Defection, is acknowledged among us who are called <hi>Protestants.</hi> How therein by various De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the corruption of the Doctrine of the Gospel gave Occasion unto the Depravation of mens man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on the one hand, and the Wickedness of mens lives on the other hand led the way unto and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make necessary a further perverting of the Doctrine it self, until at length it is hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether the multiplied Errors of that Church have made the Reintroduction of true Holiness and Evangelical Obedience, or the corrupt worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation of the generality of the members of its Communion, have rendred the Restauration of Truth more difficult &amp; unpracticable in their present sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is in part declared in the ensuing discourses, and deserves yet a more particular and distinct en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into. In general certain it is, that as Error with Superstition on the one hand in the minds of the Teachers or Guides of the Church, and Sin with Conformity unto the ways manners &amp; course of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:204232:6"/> present evil World in the Body of the People, were mutually assistant unto their joynt Introduction into the Profession and Lives of Christians; so having possessed themselves of the visible Church-state of many Nations, they are so interwoven in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, as to be mutually assistant to the exclusion of that Truth and Holiness which they have disposessed. And whereas moreover they have found out the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Infallibility, stretched wide enough in their own apprehensions, to cover patronize and justify the most enormous Errors, and highest inconformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Life unto the Gospel, all hopes of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery are utterly defeated, but what are placed on the Soveraign Grace and Almighty Power of God.</p>
            <p>That there is also another Endeavour of the same kind, and for the same general end, namely to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Doctrine of the Gospel, though in another way, and unto another extreme, vigorously carried on in the World by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and those who either absolutely or for the most part comply with them in their penitious ways, is no less known, nor ought to be much less bewailed. For this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour also is attended with many Advantages to give it success. The Corruption of the Doctrine of the Gospel in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> as it sprang out of the Ignorance, Darkness, Superstition and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Affections of the minds of men; so it is by the same means preserved. But although those things in those Ages and places, where they abounded,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204232:7"/> gave sufficient and effectuall Advantage to its gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Introduction, and although the Principles of it be now so with the secular interests of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of mankind in most of the Nations of Europe, as to secure its station &amp; possessions, yet in that Eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of Reason from under the bond of Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Tradition, in that liberty of Rational Enquiry unto the true nature and causes of all things, in that refusal to captivate their understandings in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the bare Authority of men no wiser than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which all pretend unto at present, who dare venture on an ordinary converse in the World; it may seem marvellous how it should get ground, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large its Teritories, unless it be among them, who are evidently bought off from themselves and from under the conduct of their own minds by some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Advantages, which they look upon as a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able consideration. The true Reasons hereof are enquired into in the ensuing discourse. But this new Attempt, despising the bafled Aids of Superstition and carnal Affections, which were in former Ages predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant and effectual, take shelter under a pretence of Reason, and the suitableness of what is proposed in it, unto the natural Light and understandings of men. Whatever there is or is not in this matter, of the Relation that is between Religion and Reason, yet this being grown through the encrease of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Converse, with a decay of the true fear of God, the very Idol of this Age; whoever will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204232:7"/> a sacrifice unto it, though it be of the most Holy Mysteries of the Gospel, he shall not fail of good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment and applause. And whoever shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to cast incense on its Altar, shall be sure to be exploded, as one that professeth himself to be a fool, &amp; even a Common enemy unto mankind. Tell men that there are some things in Religion that are above Reason, as it is finite and limited, and some things contrary unto it, as it is deprav'd an cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and they will reply (what is true in it self but wofully abusd) that yet their Reason is the best, yea only means, which they have to judg of what is true or false. The Liberty of mens own Rational Faculties having got the great vogue in the World, (as indeed it is that which is most excellent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of what is merely in and of it, it is fond to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that it should not meet with a pernitious abuse, as every thing that hath any worth in it, hath always done, when advanced unto such a Reputation as might render it liable thereunto. For no man will ever adventure to pervail himself of that which others have no respect unto, or do despise. Herein then lies the advantage of this sort of men, the <hi>Socinians</hi> I mean &amp; their adherents, in attempting to corrupt the Doctrine of the Gospel, &amp; hereon depends all their success therein. First they get the advantage of the ground in general, by pretending to reduce all men unto right Reason as the just measure and standard of Truth. Put in any exceptions unto this proposal,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:204232:8"/> endeavour to affix its bounds and proper measures, offer the consideration of Divine Revelation in its proper use and place, and you give away the cause among the many, who design at least to come in as common sharers in the Reputation that Reason hath got above all things in the World. By the confident use of this Artifice, and the most absurd application of this Principle unto things Infinite, and the most Holy mysteries of Divine Revelation; have this sort of men, otherwise for the most part as weak and insufficient in their reasonings, as their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors in the like attempts, got the Reputation of the most rational handlers of sacred things. And when, being harnessed with this Advantage, they proceed to the proposal of their opinions in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, they have such an interest beforehand in the minds of men by nature, and have things so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and prepared for their Reception, that it is no wonder if oftimes they obtain success. For they are all of them designed unto one of those two Heads. First that there is no Reason why we should believe any thing that Reason cannot comprehend, so that we may safely conclude, that whatever is above our Reason is contrary unto it, and for what is so, it is destructive to the very natural Constitution of our Souls not to reject. And secondly that the mind of Man is in its present condition every way sufficient unto the whole of its duties both Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Moral, with respect unto God, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:204232:8"/> whatever is required of us. Upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they pretend only to undertake the patronage of humane Natúre, and the common Reason and Honesty of mankind, against those imputations of weakness depravations and corruption in things Spiritual; wherewith by some it is charged and defamed. And although it be contrary unto the universal experience of the whole World, yet might this design be allowed what commendation men please, so that the defence of Nature were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken expresly against the Grace of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the Redemption that is in his blood; and the whole Mysterie of the Gospel. But whereas it is a part of the Depravation of our Nature not to discover its own Depravations, and all those opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are suited to give it Countenance against what it is not sensible of, and whereof it is not willing to own the charge, it is no wonder if with very many they receive a ready entertainment. And whereas they seem to interest men in that Reputation, which Reason in the things of God had obtained in the World, and thereby to countenance them in the còn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of others as weak and irrational, things plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the depraved minds of men, it is more than probable that they will make a pernitious progress in one degree or another. So doth the subtle Enemy of our Salvation make his advantage of the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inclination and state of every Age and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Without his Interposition, Devotion of old might
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:204232:9"/> have been carried on without Superstition, &amp; in this Age the use of Reason might be vindicated, without a rejection of the necessity of supernatural Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the great Truths of the Gospel. But the better any thing is, the more noysome it will be, when once he hath mixed his Poison with it.</p>
            <p>It were to be wished that the Defection from the Truth of the Gospel complained of, were confined unto the instances already mentioned, though in them the event be deplorable among multitudes of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christians. But the same in some measure and degree is come to pass among Protestants also. Men grow weary of the Truths which have been professed ever since the Reformation, yea of those in particular, which gave occasion thereunto, and without which it had never been attempted. For besides that many fall off unto those extremes of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror before insisted on, some on the one hand, and some on the other, the Reformed Religion is by not a few, so taken off from its old foundations, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinged from those Pillars of important Truths, which it did depend upon, and so sullied by a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed medly of Noysom Opinions, as that its loss in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Stability and Usefulness, seems almost ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparable. Hence are Divisions, Debates and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimosities multiplied about the principal Articles of our Religion, whereby those Tongues are divided and Hands ingaged in mutual intestine conflicts, which all united were few enough to preserve the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204232:9"/> Remainders of the Protestant Profession from the Artifices and Power of him, who doth not despair once more to impose his Yoke on the Neck of the whole Christian World. For nothing can more prepare the way of his success, than the shaking of the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency, wherein for so long a time it stood firm and stable against all opposition.</p>
            <p>But there is in this matter nothing absolutely new under the the Sun; no instance can be given of any Church or Nation in the World, which ever received the profession of the Gospel, that did not sooner or later either totally or in some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Degrees, fall off from the Doctrine which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veles and the Obedience which it requireth. Men do but deceive themselves, who suppose that the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Religion will be preserved in Confessions and Canons, whilst some make it their business to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt its Truth, and few or none make it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to preserve its Power. And therefore at this day on one account or other the Defection is almost Catholick. For it is in vain for any to pretend that the present general visible Profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, doth in any tolerable measure answer the Original Pattern of it in the Scripture, or the first Transcript thereof in the primitive Believers. And that, which in this degenerate state of things doth principally exercise the minds of considerate men, is, whether there ought to be an immediat
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:204232:10"/> Endeavour to reduce as many as will or can comply therewith, unto the original standard in Profession Obedience and Worships, or whether the present posture of things be not so far to be complyed withal, as to preserve therein the small Remainders of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among the Community of Christians who are not capable of such a Reduction. The difference, that is in the Judgments of men herein, is the ground of all those lesser Controversies and Opinions, which will be composed and have an end put unto them, when God shall graciously afford unto us all a fresh revival of Evangelical Faith, Love and Holiness, and, I fear, not before.</p>
            <p>Upon some Considerations of this state of things in the World, and under fears, perhaps not altogether groundless, that a further progress will yet be made in this woful declension from the Power and Purity of Evangelical Truth, <hi>I</hi> set my self into a general En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry what might be the secret Causes, and Reasons whence it is that all sorts of Persons in all Ages have been so prone to apostatize from the sincere profession of the Gospel in Faith and Obedience, as Experience in the success of things manifests them to have been. And moreover an occasion was administred unto thoughts of that nature, from my engagement in the Exposition of the sixth Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrēws,</hi> wherein the Apostle so eminently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the nature of total Apostacy, with the end of Apostates in the righteous Judgment of God.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:204232:10"/> For considering the greatness of that sin, and the Terror of the Lord with respect thereunto, and not knowing whereunto the daily advance of impiety, prophaneness and abominable lusts, with ignorance, Error, and superstition, might at length arrive; thoughtfulness of what might be required at the last day of my self, though cast in a mean and obscure condition in the World, did not a little exercise my mind. The Glory of God, the honour of Christ and the Gospel, the Eternal welfare of the Souls of men being eminently concerned, I knew not how he could have the least satisfaction in the Truth and Reality of his own Christianity, who was not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with, and did not really mourn for their suffering in this woful Apostasie. What I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto in that kind, I have no Reason to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare; but hope I may say without the offence of any, that, as I verily believe, neither my Prayers nor Tears have been proportionable unto the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of them in this matter, so I can and will say that they have been real and sincere.</p>
            <p>I was not Ignorant of the Weakness and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency of all thoughts, that a Person of my mean condition in the World, disadvantaged by all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable circumstances that might prejudice the most sincere Endeavours, should attempt any thing with respect unto the Relief of Nations or National Churches, which yet are not without the verge of this fatal Evil. To mourn for them in secret, to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:204232:11"/> labour in prayers and supplications for a more plentifull effusion of the Spirit of Christ upon them for their good, are things which although they may despise, yet God will accept in and from the meanest of them that call on his name in sincerity. Ʋnto whom other Oportunities and Advantages are granted, from them other things will be required. And it is no doubt a great account they have to give, who are admitted and esteemed as those whose Place and Duty it is, to stem the current of overflowing Impiety and Prophaneness, and effectually to apply the Sovereign Remedies of all those evils unto the Souls and Consciences of men. Sad will it be for them under whose hand this breach shall be, if they endeavour not to prevent it with their utmost di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and the open hazard of all their earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. A learned writer of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> affirms, <hi>That there were two, no small sins of noysome Hypocrisie, that he had espied among others; the one an opinion there can be no fit matter of Martyrdom in a State authorizing the true profession of that Religion which among many we like best, and left unto our selves would make choyce of. The other which in part feeds a perswasion that meer Errors in Doctrine or Opinion, are more pernitious than affected indulgence to lewd Practices, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in sinfull courses, or open breaches of Gods Commandements:</hi> And after he had declared,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:204232:11"/> that <hi>Ministers of the Gospel may deny Christ, or manifest their being ashamed of the Gospel, by not opposing his Word as they ought unto the Sins of men;</hi> he adds; <hi>that any Age since Christian Religion was first propagated, hath wanted store of Martyrs, is more to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Negligence, Ignorance and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, or want of Courage in Christ's Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, or appointed Pastors, than unto the Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Mildness or Fidelity of the Flock, especially of the Bell-weathers or chief Ring-leaders; Jac. Tom.</hi> 1: <hi>B.</hi> 4: <hi>C.</hi> 4: with much more to the same purpose, which will deserve some mens considerations, before all things of this Nature be too late.</p>
            <p>But there is a Duty of trading with a single Talent. And if there be a ready mind, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted according to what a man hath, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he hath not. And this alone hath made me adventure the proposal of my thoughts about the Nature, Causes, and Occasions of the present Defection from the Gospel, and Decay of Holiness, with the means of Preservation from its Infection, and Prevention of its Prevalency in private Persons. For it is to no purpose to shut up all endeavours under Fruitless Complaints, nor yet to attempt an Opposition unto Effects whose Causes are not well known and considered. Wherefore the Investigation and Declaration of the Causes of this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204232:12"/> evil, is the principal subject of the ensuing discourses. And if I have attained but thus much, that Persons of more Ʋnderstanding and Abilities to find out the hidden Springs of the inundations of Sin and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the Christian World, and who have more Advantages to improve their discoveries unto pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, shall be hereby excited to undertake so necessary a Work and Duty, I shall esteem my self to have received a full reward.</p>
            <p>There is one thing yet whereof I must advise those Readers which are pleased to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in any writings of mine. The publishing of this Exposition of some verses of the sixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Epistle unto the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> may have an appearance of my deserting that continued Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the whole Epistle, which I had designed. But as I know not what I may attain unto, in the very near Approach of that Season, wherein I must lay down this Tabernacle, and the daily warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which through many infirmities I have thereof, so I am resolved whilst I live, to proceed in that work as God shall enable, and other present necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duties will allow. And the Sole Reason added unto the seasonableness (as I supposed) of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, why this part of the Exposition is singly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto publick view, was, because the thoughts which arose thereon were drawn forth into such a length, as would have been too great a Digression from the context and design of the Apostle.</p>

               <p>THat this passage in our Apostles dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course hath been looked upon as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with great Difficulties, is known to all. And many have the differences been about its Interpretation. For both Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally &amp; Practically, sundry have here stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and miscarried. It is almost generally agreed upon, that from these words, and the colourable but indeed perverse Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and application made of them by some in the Primitive times, occasioned by the then present Circumstances of things,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204232:15"/> to be mentioned afterwards, the <hi>Latin</hi> Church was so backward in receiving the Epistle it self, that it had not absolutely prevailed therein in the days of <hi>Hierome,</hi> as we have elsewhere declared. Wherefore it is necessary, that we should a little inquire into the occasion of the great contests which have been in the Church almost in all Ages, about the sence of this place.</p>
               <p>It is known that the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Duty, was carefully watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full about the Holiness and upright walking of all that were admitted into the Society and fellowship of it. Hence, upon every known and visible failing, they required an open Repentance from the Offenders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would admit them unto a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the sacred Mysteries. But upon flagitious and scandalous crimes, such as Murder, Adultery, or Idolatry, in many Churches they would never admit those who had been guilty of them into their Communion any more. Their greatest and most signal triall, was with respect unto them, who through fear of death complyed with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their Idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in the time of persecution. For they had fixed no certain general Rule whereby they should unanimously proceed, but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:204232:15"/> every Church exercised Severity or Lenity, according as they saw cause, upon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of particular instances. Hence <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his banishment would not posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively determine concerning those of the Church in <hi>Carthage,</hi> who had so sinned and fallen, but defer'd his thoughts until his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; when he resolved to advise with the whole Church, and settle all things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the councell that should be agreed on amongst them. Yea many of his Epistles are on this subject, peculiarly; and in them all, if compared together, it is evident, that there was no Rule agreed upon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; nor was he himself well resolved in his own mind, though strictly on all occasions opposing <hi>Novatianus,</hi> wherein it had been well if his Arguments had answered his Zeal. Before this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was esteemed in particular more remiss in their Discipline, and more free than other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in their readmission unto Communion, of notorious Offenders. Hence <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book <hi>de Paenitentia,</hi> reflects on <hi>Zephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he had <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Adulterers unto Repentance, and thereby unto the communion of the Church.</hi> But that Church proceeding in her Lenity, and every day enlarging her charity, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:204232:16"/>
                  <hi>and Novatianus,</hi> taking offence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, advanced an opinion in the contrary extreame. For they denyed all hope of Church-pardon, or of a Return unto Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Communion, unto them who had fall'n into open sin after Baptism; and in especial peremptorily excluded all Persons whatsoever who had outwardly complied with Idolatrous Worship in time of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, without respect unto any distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing circumstances. Yea they seem to have excluded them from all exspectation of forgiveness from God himself. But their followers terrified with the uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and horror of this perswasion, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it so far, as leaving all Persons absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the mercy of God upon their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they only denyed such as we menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before a readmission into Church communion, as <hi>Acesius</hi> speaks expressly in <hi>Socrates; l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. Now this opinion they endeavoured to confirm, as from the nature and use of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> which was not to be reiterated; whereon they judged, that no pardon was to be granted unto them, who fell into those sins which they lived in before, and were cleansed from at their <hi>Baptisme;</hi> So principally from this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204232:16"/> place of our Apostle, wherein they thought their whole Opinion was taught and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:204232:17"/> given in the Scripture, that the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians</hi> transgressed the Rule of Charity and Gospel-discipline in their Severities; yet as it should seem, and is very probable, knew not how to answer the Objection from this place of our Apostle. Therefore did they rather choose for a season, to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend their assent unto the Authority of the whole <hi>Epistle,</hi> than to prejudice the Church by its Admission. And well was it that some Learned men afterwards by their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Interpretations of the words, plainly evinced that no Countenance was given in them unto the errors of the <hi>Navatians;</hi> for without this it is much to be feared that some would have preferred their interest in their present controversie, before the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of it, which would in the issue have proved ruinous to the Truth it self. For the Epistle being designed of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the common Edification of the Church, would have at length prevailed, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sence men through their prejudices and ignorance should put upon any passages of it. But this controversie is long since bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; the Generality of the Churches in the world being sufficiently remote from that which was truly the mistake of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> yea the most of them do bear
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:204232:17"/> peaceably in their Communion, without the least exercise of Gospel-discipline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, such persons as concerning whom the dispute was of old, whether they should ever in this world be admitted into the Communion of the Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though upon their open and professed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. We shall not therefore at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent need to labour in this controversie.</p>
               <p>But the sence of these words hath been the subject of great contests, on other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions also. For some doe suppose, and contend, that they are <hi>real and true Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> who are <hi>decyphered</hi> by the Apostle, and that their <hi>Character</hi> is given us in and by sundry inseparable adjuncts, and properties of such Persons; Hence they conclude, that such Believers may <hi>totally and finally fall from Grace,</hi> and perish eternally. Yea it is evident that this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the final Apostacy of true Believers, is that which influenceth their minds and judgements to suppose that such are here intended. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others who will not admit that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenor of the Covenant of Grace in Christ Jesus, true Believers can perish everlastingly, do say, that either they are not here intended, or if they are, that the words are only comminatory, wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:204232:18"/> the <hi>Consequence</hi> in them in a way of arguing be true, namely that on the <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> laid down, the <hi>inference</hi> is certain, yet the <hi>supposition</hi> is not asserted in order unto a certain Consequent, whence it should follow that true Believers might so really fall away, and absolutely perish. And these things have been the matter of many contests among Learned men.</p>
               <p>Again; there have been sundry mistakes in the <hi>practical Application</hi> of the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these words, unto the Consciences of men, mostly made by themselves, who are concerned. For whereas by reason of sin, they have been surprized with Terrors and troubles of Conscience, they have withall in their Darkness and Distress, supposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be fallen into the condition here discribed by our Apostle; and consequently to be irrecoverably lost. And these Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions usually befall men on two occasions. For some having been overtaken with some <hi>great actual sin,</hi> against the <hi>second Table,</hi> after they have made a profession of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and having their consciences harrased with a sense of their Guilt, (as it will fall out where men are not greatly hardned through the deceitfullness of sin) they judg that they are fallen under the sentence denounced in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204232:18"/> this Scripture against such sinners, as they suppose themselves to be, whereby their state is irrecoverable. Others doe make the same judgement of themselves, because they have <hi>fallen</hi> from that constant Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with their Convictions, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led them unto a strict performance of Duties, and this in some course of long continuance. Now whereas it is certain, that the Apostle in this discourse gives no countenance unto that severity of the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> whereby they excluded offenders everlastingly from the peace and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church; nor to the <hi>final Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of true Believers, which he testifieth against in this very Chapter, in compliance with innumerable other Testimonies of Scripture to the same purpose; nor doth he teach any thing whereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>conscience of any sinner,</hi> who desires to return to God and to finde acceptance with him, should be discouraged or disheartned; we must attend unto the Exposition of the Words, in the first place, so as not to break in upon the boundaries of other Truths, nor trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress against the <hi>Analogy</hi> of faith. And we shall find that this whole discourse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with other Scriptures, and freed from the prejudices that men have brought
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:204232:19"/> unto it, is both remote from administring any just occasion to the mistakes before mentioned, and is a needfull wholsom commination, duely to be considered by all Professors of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>In the words, we consider, 1. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of them unto those foregoing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating the occasion of the Introduction of this whole discourse. 2. The Subject described in them, or the Persons spoken of, under sundry Qualifications, which may be enquired into, joyntly and severally. 3. What is supposed concerning them. 4. What is affirmed of them on that Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Connexion of the words is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the <hi>causal conjunction;</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> of a Reason for what had been before discoursed, as also of the Limitation which the Apostle added expressely unto his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of making a progress in their farther instruction; <hi>if God permit.</hi> And he doth not herein express his judgement that they to whom he wrote were such as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes, for he afterwards declares that he <hi>hoped better things</hi> concerning them; only it was necessary to give them this caution, that they might take due care not to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:204232:19"/> such. And whereas he had manifested that they were <hi>slow</hi> as to the making of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in knowledge, and a suitable practice; he lets them here know the danger that there was in continuing in that <hi>slothfull</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For not to proceed in the wayes of the Gospel and Obedience thereunto, is an untoward entrance into a total Relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishment of the one and the other. That therefore they might be acquainted with the Danger hereof, and be stirred up to avoyd that Danger, he gives them an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the miserable Condition of those who after a Profession of the Gospel, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at a <hi>Non-proficiency</hi> under it, do end in <hi>Apostasie</hi> from it. And we may see, <hi>That the severest Comminations, are not onely usefull in the Preaching of the Gospel, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding necessary towards Persons that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be slothfull in their Profession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Description of the Persons that are the Subject spoken of, is given in <hi>five Instances</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Priviledges whereof they were made partakers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all which, and against their obliging Efficacy to the contrary, it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that they may wholly desert the Gospel it self. And some things we may observe concerning this Description of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:204232:20"/> them in general. As, 1. The Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to express the fearfull State and Judgement of these Persons, describes them by such things as may fully evidence it to be, as <hi>unavoidable,</hi> so <hi>righteous</hi> and equal. Those things must be some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Priviledges and Advantages, whereof they were made partakers by the Gospel. These being despised in their <hi>Apostacy,</hi> doe proclaim their destruction from God to be rightly deserved. 2. That all these Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges do consist in certain especial Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Ghost, which were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar unto the Dispensation of the Gospel; such as they neither were, nor could be made partakers of in their <hi>Iudaisme.</hi> For the Spirit in this sence, was not received by <hi>the works of the Law, but by the hearing of faith, Gal.</hi> 3. 2. And this was a Testimony unto them that they were delivered from the Bondage of the Law, namely by a participation of that <hi>Spirit</hi> which was the great Priviledge of the Gospel. 3. Here is no express mention of any Covenant<hi>-Grace,</hi> or Mercy, in them, or towards them; nor of any <hi>Duty</hi> of Faith, or Obedince, which they had performed. Nothing of <hi>Justification, Sanctification,</hi> or <hi>Adoption,</hi> is expresly assigned unto them. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:204232:20"/> when he comes to declare his hopes and perswasion concerning these <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that they were not such as those whom he had before described nor such as would so fall away unto perdition, He doth it upon three grounds whereon they were differenced from them. As, 1. That they had <hi>such things as did accompany Salvation,</hi> that is, such as Salvation is inseparable from. None of these things therefore had he ascribed unto those whom he describeth in this place; for if he had so done, they would not have been unto him an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Evidence of a contrary End, that these should not fall away and perish as well as those. Wherefore he ascribes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to these here in the Text, that doth peculiarly <hi>accompany Salvation,</hi> vers. 9. 2. He describes them, by their <hi>Duties of Obedience</hi> and Fruits of Faith. This was their <hi>work and labour of Love</hi> towards the Name of God, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. And hereby also doth he difference them from these in the Text, concerning whom he supposeth that they may perish eternally; which these Fruits of saving Faith and sincere Love cannot doe. 3. He addes, that in the preservation of those there mentioned, the <hi>Faithfulness of God</hi> was concerned; <hi>God is</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:204232:21"/>
                  <hi>not unrighteous to forget.</hi> For they were such (he intended) as were interested in the Covenant of Grace, with respect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto alone, there is any engagement on the <hi>Faithfulness</hi> or <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve men from Apostasie and Ruine; and there is so with an equal respect unto all who are so taken into that Covenant. But of these in the Text, he supposeth no such thing, and thereupon doth not intimate, that either the Righteousness or Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God were any way engaged for their preservation, but rather the contrary. This whole description therefore referres unto some especial <hi>Gospel Priviledges</hi> which Professors in those dayes were promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously made partakers of, and what they were in particular, we must in the next place enquire.</p>
               <p>The first thing in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription is, that they were <note place="margin">

                  <hi>dayes of Light.</hi> Hereunto the <hi>Syriack</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter seems to have had respect: And the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>once,</hi> may give countenance hereunto. Baptism was once onely to be celebrated, according to the constant Faith of the Church in all Ages. And they called Baptism <hi>Illumination,</hi> because it being one Ordinance of the Initiation of Persons into a participation of all the mysteries of the Church, they were thereby translated out of the Kingdome of Darkness into that of Light and Grace. And it seems to give fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countenance hereunto, in that, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> really was the beginning and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a participation of all the other spiritual Priviledges that are mentioned afterwards. For it was usual in those times, that upon the baptizing of persons, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with extraordinary gifts peculiar to the dayes of the Gospel, as we have shewed in our consideration of the Order between <hi>Baptisme</hi> and <hi>Imposition of hands.</hi> And this Opinion hath so much of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in it, that having nothing therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all unsuited unto the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Faith, or Design of the place, that I should embrace it, if the word it self as here used, did not require another Interpretation. For it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:204232:22"/> was a good while after the writing of this Epistle, and all other parts of the New Testament, at least an Age or two, if not more, before this word was used <hi>Mystically</hi> to express Baptism. In the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it hath another sence, denoting an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Operation of the Spirit, and not the outward Administration of an Ordinance. And it is too much boldness to take a word in a peculiar sence in one single place, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse from its proper signification and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant use, if there be no circumstances in the Text forcing us thereunto, as here are not. And for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Once,</hi> it is not to be restrained unto this particular, but referres equally unto all the instances that follow; signifying no more but that those mentioned were really and truely parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of them.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:204232:23"/> Errors and Superstition do dwell and reign. By the Power and Efficacy of this Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness are men kept at a distance from God, and know not whither they goe. This is called <hi>walking in Darkness,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 6. whereunto <hi>walking in the Light,</hi> that is, the Knowledge of God in Christ by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, is opposed, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. On this Account is our Instruction in the Knowledge of the Gospel called <hi>Illumination,</hi> because it self is <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. On the Account of the <hi>Subject,</hi> or the <hi>Mind</hi> it self, whereby the Gospel is apprehended. For the Knowledge which is received thereby, expells that Darkness, Ignorance and Confusion, which the Mind before was filled and possessed withall. The Knowledge, I say, of the Doctrines of the Gospel, concerning the Person of Christ, of God's being in him reconciling the World to himself, of his Offices, Work and Mediation, and the like Heads of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, doth set up a <hi>spiritual Light</hi> in the Minds of Men, enabling them to discern what before was utterly hid from them, whilest alienated from the Life of God, through their Ignorance. Of this Light and Knowledge there are several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, according to the Means of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:204232:23"/> which they do enjoy, the Capacity they have to receive it, and the Diligence they use to that purpose: But a competent measure of the Knowledge of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and most material Principles or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Gospel is required, unto all that may thence be said to be <hi>illuminated;</hi> that is, freed from the Darkness and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they once lived in, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19, 20. This is the first Property whereby the Persons intended, are described; they are such as were <hi>illuminated</hi> by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction they had received in the Doctrine of the Gospel, and the Impression made thereby on their Minds, by the Holy Ghost; for this is a common work of his, and is here so reckoned: And the Apostle would have us know, that</p>

                     <hi>III.</hi> Where there is a Total Neglect of the due Improvement of this Priviledge and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:204232:24"/> Mercy, the Condition of such Persons is hazardous, as inclining towards Apostasie.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus much lyes open and manifest in the Text. But that we may more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly discover the Nature of this first part of the Character of Apostates, for their sakes who may look after their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment therein, we may yet a little more distinctly express the Nature of that Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Knowledge which is here ascribed unto them; and how it is lost in <hi>Apostasie,</hi> will afterwards appear. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a Knowledge of Spiritual things, that is purely <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinary,</hi> attainable and attained without any especial Aid or Assistance of the Holy Ghost. As this is evident in common Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, so especially among such as cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves on the study of Spiritual things, are yet utter strangers unto all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gifts. Some Knowledge of the Scripture and the things contained in it, is attainable at the same rate of pains and study with that of any other Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Illumination</hi> intended, being a Gift of the Holy Ghost, differs from, and is exalted above this Knowledge that is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:204232:24"/> purely <hi>natural.</hi> For it makes neerer Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches unto the Light of Spiritual things in their own Nature, than the other doth. Notwithstanding the utmost improvement of Scientifical Notions that are purely Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, the things of the Gospel in their own Nature are not onely unsuited unto the Wills and Affections of Persons endued with them, but are really <hi>Foolishness</hi> unto their Minds. And as unto that Goodness and Excellency which give Desireableness unto Spiritual things, this Knowledge disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers so little of them, that most men hate the things which they profess to Believe. But this <hi>Spiritual Illumination</hi> gives the Mind some Satisfaction with Delight and Joy in the things that are known. By that Beam whereby it shines into Darkness, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not fully comprehended, yet it represents the way of the Gospel as a way of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. which reflects a peculiar Regard of it on the Mind.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Knowledge that is meerly <hi>Natural,</hi> hath little or no Power upon the Soul, either to keep it from Sin or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain it to Obedience. There is not a more secure and profligate Generation of Sinners in the world, than those who are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:204232:25"/> under the sole conduct of it. But the <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination</hi> here intended, is attended with Efficacy, doth effectually press in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and whole Soul, unto an abstinence from Sin, and the Performance of all known Dutyes: Hence Persons under the Power of it and its Convictions, do oft-times walk blamelesly and uprightly in the world, so as not with the other to contribute unto the Contempt of Christianity. Besides, there is such an Allicance between spiritual Gifts, that where any one of them doth reside, it hath assuredly other accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, or one way or other belonging unto its train, as is manifest in this place. Even a single Talent is made up of many pounds. But the Light and Knowledge which is of a mere Natural Acquirement, is solitary, destitute of the Society and Countenance of any spiritual Gift what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And these things are exemplified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to common observation every day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a saving, sanctifying Light and Knowledge, which this <hi>Spiritual Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination</hi> riseth not up unto: For, though it transiently affect the Mind with some Glances of the Beauty, Glory, and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Spiritual things; yet it doth not give that direct, steady, intuitive insight
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204232:25"/> into them, which is obtained by Grace. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Chap. 4. 4, 6. Neither doth it renew, change, or transform the Soul into a Conformity unto the things known, by planting of them in the Will and Affections, as a gracious, saving Light doth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. These things I judged necessary to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to clear the Nature of the first Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Apostates.</p>

                  </gap>; that is, to be <gap reason="foreign">

He therefore is this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>heavenly Gift</hi> here intended, though not absolutely, but with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an especial work.</p>
               <p>That which riseth up against this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, is, that the Holy Ghost is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely mentioned in the next Clause; <hi>And were made partakers of the Holy Ghost.</hi> It is not therefore probable that He should be here also intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> (1.) It is ordinary to have the same thing twice expressed in various words, to quicken the sence of them; and it is necessary it should be so, when there are divers respects unto the same thing; as there are in this place.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The following Clause may be <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical</hi> of this, declaring more fully and plainly what is here intended, which is usual also in the Scripture; so that nothing is cogent from this Consideration, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove an Interpretation so suited to the sence of the place, and which the constant use of the word makes necessary to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. But,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:204232:27"/> (3.) The Holy Ghost is here mentioned as the great <hi>Gift</hi> of the <hi>Gospel times,</hi> as <hi>coming down from Heaven,</hi> not absolutely, not as unto his Person, but with respect unto an especial Work; namely, the change of the whole State of Religious Worship in the Church of God; whereas, we shall see in the next words, he is spoken of onely with respect unto external actual Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But he was the great, the promised heavenly Gift, to be bestowed under the New Testament, by whom God would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute and ordain a new Way, and new Rites of Worship, upon the Revelation of himself and Will in Christ. Unto him was committed the Reformation of all things in the Church, whose time was now come. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 10. The Lord Christ when he ascended into Heaven, left all things stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and continuing in Religious Worship, as they had done from the dayes of <hi>Moses;</hi> though he had virtually put an end unto it. And he commanded his Disciples, that they should attempt no Alteration therein, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the <hi>Holy Ghost were sent from Heaven</hi> to enable them thereunto, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5. But when he came as the great Gift of God, promised under the New Testament, he removes all the Carnal Worship and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:204232:28"/> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and that by the full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Accomplishment of all that was signified by them; and appoints the New, Holy, Spiritual Worship of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, that was to succed in their Room. The Spirit of God therefore, as bestowed for the Introduction of the <hi>New Gospel-state,</hi> in Truth and Worship, is the <hi>heavenly Gift</hi> here intended. Thus our Apostle warneth these <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that they <hi>turn not away from him who speaketh from Heaven,</hi> Chap. 12. 25. that is, Jesus Christ speaking in the Dispensation of the Gospel by the <hi>holy Ghost sent from Heaven.</hi> And there is an <hi>Antithesis</hi> included herein, between the Law and the Gospel; the former being given on <hi>Earth,</hi> the latter being immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from <hi>Heaven.</hi> God in giving of the Law made use of the Ministry of <hi>Angels</hi> and that on the Earth; But he gave the Gospel Church-state, by that Spirit which although he worketh on men in Earth, and is said in every Act or Work to be sent <hi>from</hi> Heaven, yet is he still <hi>in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and alwayes speaketh from thence; as our Saviour said of himself, with respect unto his Divine Nature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We may enquire, what it is to <hi>taste</hi> of this Heavenly Gift. <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:204232:28"/> The Expression of <hi>tasting</hi> is <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> and signifies no more but to make a <hi>Trial</hi> or Experiment; For so we doe by <hi>tasting,</hi> naturally and properly of that which is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unto us to eat. We <hi>taste</hi> such things by the sense given us to discern our Food, and then either receive or refuse them as we find Occasion. It doth not therefore include <hi>eating,</hi> much less digestion and turning into Nourishment of what is so tasted. For its Nature being onely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by discerned, it may be refused, yea though we like its relish and savour upon some other Consideration. Some have observed, that to <hi>taste,</hi> is as much as to <hi>eat;</hi> as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 35. <hi>I will not taste Bread, or ought else.</hi> But the meaning is, I will not <hi>so much as taste</hi> it, whence it was impossible he should eat it. And when <hi>Jonathan</hi> sayes, that he onely <hi>tasted</hi> a little of the Honey, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 29. it was an Excuse and Extenuation of what he had done. But it is unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably used for some kind of Experience of the Nature of things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 18. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>she tasteth that her Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize is good;</hi> or hath experience of it, from its encrease, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 8. <hi>O taste and see that the Lord is good;</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>If so be that ye have</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:204232:29"/>
                  <hi>tasted that the Lord is gracious;</hi> or found it so by Experience. It is therefore Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to make an Experiment or trial of any thing, whether it be received or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused; and is sometimes opposed to Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Digestion, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 34. That therefore which is ascribed unto these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, is, that they had had an Experience of the Power of the Holy Ghost, that Gift of God, in the Dispensation of the Gospel, the Revelation of the Truth, and Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spiritual Worship of it; Of this State, and of the Excellency of it, they had made some Trial, and had some Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; a Priviledge that all men were not made partakers of. And by this <hi>taste</hi> they were convinced, that it was far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, than what they had been before accustomed unto, although now they had a mind to leave the finest Wheat for their old Acorns. Wherefore, although <hi>tasting</hi> contain a Diminution in it, if compared with that <hi>spiritual Eating and Drinking,</hi> with that Digestion of Gospel Truths, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into Nourishment, which are in true Believers; yet absolutely considered, it denotes that Apprehension and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Excellency of the Gospel as administred by the Spirit, which is a great
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:204232:29"/> Priviledge and spiritual Advantage, the contempt whereof will prove an unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Aggravation of the Sin, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediless ruine of Apostates. The meaning then of this <hi>Character</hi> given concerning these <hi>Apostates</hi> is, that they had some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Power and Efficacy of the Holy Spirit from Heaven, in Gospel Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations and Worship. For what some say of <hi>Faith,</hi> it hath here no place; and what others affirm of Christ, and his being the Gift of God, comes in the Issue unto what we have proposed. And we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, further to clear the design of the Apostle in this Commination.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>That all the Gifts of God under the Gospel are peculiarly Heavenly, Joh.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 3. and that in opposition, (1) To <hi>earthly</hi> things, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 11, 12.

So to partake of him, is to have a part share or portion in what he distributes by way of spiritual Gifts; in answer unto that Expression; <hi>All these worketh that one and self-same Spirit, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto every one severally as he will,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. So <hi>Peter</hi> told <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Magician,</hi> that he had no <hi>Part</hi> in spiritual Gifts, he was not partaker of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 21. Wherefore, to be <hi>partaker of the Holy Ghost,</hi> is to have a share in, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his spiritual Operations.</p>
               <p>But, whereas the other things mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are also Gifts or Operations of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, on what Ground or for what Reason, is this mentioned here in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that they were made partakers of him, which if his Operations onely be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, seems to be expressed in the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> (1) It is, as we observed before, no unusual thing in the Scripture, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the same thing under various Notions, the more effectually to impress a Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and sence of it on our mind; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:204232:31"/> where an Expression hath a singular <hi>Emphasis</hi> in it, as this hath here used: For, it is an exceeding aggravation of the sins of these <hi>Apostates,</hi> that in these things they were partakers of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) As was before intimated also, this participation of the Holy Ghost, is placed it may be in the midst of the several parts of this Description, as that whereon they do all depend, and they are all but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it. They were partakers of the Holy Ghost, in that they <hi>were once enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and so of the rest.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It expresseth their own personal Interest in these things. They had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the things mentioned not onely <hi>objectively,</hi> as they were proposed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to them in the Church; but <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively</hi> they themselves in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were made partakers of them. It is one thing for a man to have a share in, and benefit by the Gifts of the Church, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be personally himself endowed with them.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) To mind them in an especial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Priviledge they enjoyed under the Gospel, above what they had in their <hi>Judaisme.</hi> For, whereas they had not then so much as heard that there was a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:204232:31"/> Holy Ghost, that is, a blessed Dispensation of him in spiritual Gifts, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 2; Now they themselves in their own Persons were made partakers of him, than which there could be no greater aggravation of their <hi>Apostasie:</hi> And we may observe in our way, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Holy Ghost is present with many as unto powerfull Operations, with whom he is not present as to gracious Inhabitation:</hi> Or, Many are made partakers of him in his <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gifts,</hi> who are never made partakers of him in his <hi>saving Graces. Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is added in the Description, that they had tasted <note place="margin">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:204232:32"/> unto God, his Word as preached and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 68. The <hi>Word of God,</hi> that is, the Word of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel as Preached is that which they thus tasted of. But it may be said, that they enjoyed the Word of God in their state of <hi>Judaisme:</hi> They did so, as to the <hi>written Word;</hi> for unto them were <hi>committed the Oracles of God, Rom.</hi> 3. 2. But it is the Word of God as <hi>preached in the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel</hi> that is eminently thus called, and concerning which such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things are spoken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Word is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>good,</hi> desireable, amiable, as the word here used signifieth. Wherein it is so, we shall see immediately. But whereas the Word of God preached under the Dispensation of the Gospel, may be considered two wayes; (1) In General, as to the whole <hi>Systeme</hi> of Truths contained therein; And (2) In Especial, for the <hi>Declaration</hi> made of the Accomplishment of the <hi>Promise</hi> in sending <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> for the Redemption of the Church; it is here especially intended in this latter sence. This is <hi>emphatically</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 25. So the Promise of God in particular is called <hi>his Good Word;</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:204232:32"/>
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 10. <hi>After Seventy years I will visit you, and perform my good word towards you;</hi> as he calls it the <hi>good thing</hi> that he had promised, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33. 14. The Gospel is the good tidings of Peace and Salvation by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereof they are said <hi>to taste,</hi> as they were before of the <hi>heavenly Gift.</hi> The Apostle as it were studiously keeps himself to this Expression, on purpose to manifest that he intendeth not those who by Faith do really receive, feed, and live on Jesus Christ, as tendred in the Word of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 35, 49, 50, 51, 54, 55. It is as if he had said; I speak not of those who have received and digested the spiritual Food of their Souls, and turned it into spiritual Nourishment; but of such as have so far <hi>tasted</hi> of it, as that they ought to have desired it as <hi>sincere Milk</hi> to have grown thereby; But they had received such an Experiment of its Divine Truth and Power, as that it had various Effects upon them. And for the further Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of these words, and therein of the Description of the State of these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Apostates, we may consider the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Observations; which declare the sence of the words, or what is contained in them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:204232:33"/> I. <hi>There is a Goodness and Excellency in the Word of God, able to Attract and affect the Minds of men, who yet never arrive at sincere Obedience unto it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>There is an especial Goodness in the Word of the Promise, concerning Jesus Christ, and the declaration of its Accomplishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) For the first of these Propositions, we may enquire what is that <hi>Goodness,</hi> and wherein it doth consist; as also how Apostatizing Backsliders may <hi>taste</hi> thereof; which things tend to the Explanation of the words, and what is designed by the Apostle in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This <hi>Goodness</hi> and Excellency of the Word of God consists in its <hi>spiritual hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Truth.</hi> All Truth is beautifull and desireable; the Perfection of the Minds of Men consists in the Reception of it and Conformity unto it. And although, <hi>True</hi> be one consideration of any thing and <hi>Good</hi> another, yet they are inseparable Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the same Subject. Whatever is <hi>true</hi> is also <hi>good.</hi> So are these things put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Apostle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 8. And as <hi>Truth</hi> is Good in it self, so is it in its Effects on the Minds of men; it gives them Peace,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:204232:33"/> Satisfaction, and Contentment. Darkness, Errors, Falshood, are Evils in themselves, and fill the Minds of Men with variety, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, superstition, dread and bondage. It is <hi>Truth</hi> that makes the Soul <hi>free</hi> in any kind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 32. Now the Word of God is the onely pure, immixed and solid Truth. <hi>Thy Word is Truth, Joh.</hi> 17. 17. In most other things as to the best evidence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, men wander in the wilderness of endless Conjectures. The Truth of the Word of God alone, is stable, firm, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and which gives rest to the Soul. As God is a <hi>God of Truth, Deut.</hi> 32. 4. the <hi>onely true God, Joh.</hi> 17. 3. so he is, and he is alone essentially Truth, and the eternal Spring of it unto all other things. Hereof is this Word the onely Revelation. How excellent, how desirable therefore must it needs be, and what a <hi>Goodness</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred above all other things must it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed withall! As it is infallible Truth giving Light to the Eyes and Rest to the Soul, it is the <hi>good Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is so in the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, or the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines contained in it. As, (1) The <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of God are declared therein. God being onely good, the onely Fountain and Cause of all Goodness, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:204232:34"/> in whose Enjoyment all Rest and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness doth consist, the Revelation made of him, his Nature and Attributes, reflects a singular Goodness on it. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. If it be incomparably better to know God, than to enjoy the whole World and all that is in it, that Word must be <hi>good</hi> whereby he is revealed unto us, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 9. 23, 24. (2) It is exceeding <hi>good</hi> in the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the glorious Mystery of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> therein alone contained. This is that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery the knowledge whereof is the onely Means to have a right Apprehension of all other sacred Truths; and without it, no one of them can be understood in a due Manner, nor improved unto a due End. This is that alone which will give true Rest and Peace to the Soul. And there is not the meanest true Believer in the World, who is exercised in Faith and Obedience, but he hath the Power of this Truth in and upon his Mind, though he be not able to speak much of the Notions of it. All Grace and Truth are built hereon, and do center herein, and thence derive their first Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Efficacy. Not one saving Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension can we have of any gracious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation of God towards us, but it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into the Existence of God in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:204232:34"/> of Persons, and the Oeconomy of their Operations with respect unto us. It is a <hi>good</hi> Word whereby that Mystery is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. (3) It is so in the Revelation of the whole Mystery of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>the Son of God,</hi> with all the Effects of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wisdom and Grace thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. What a satisfactory Goodness this is accompanyed withall, it is the most part of my business in this world to inquire and declare. (4) It is so in the Declaration of all the <hi>Benefits</hi> of the <hi>Mediation of Christ,</hi> in Mercy, Grace, Pardon, Justification, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>good</hi> Word with respect unto its <hi>blessed Effects, Psal.</hi> 19. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. On this Account the Psalmist assures us, that it is <hi>more to be desired than Gold, yea than much fine Gold;</hi> that it is <hi>sweeter than the Honey or the Heney-comb, Psal.</hi> 19. 10. That is, there is an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Excellency, Worth and Goodness in it. And he who discerns not this <hi>Goodness</hi> in the Word of God, is a stranger unto all real Benefits by it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) How <hi>Apostatizing</hi> Persons do <hi>taste</hi> of this <hi>good Word of God</hi> may be briefly declared. And their so doing hath respect unto the three-fold Property of it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:204232:35"/> whence it is denominated Good: (1) Its <hi>Truth;</hi> (2) Its <hi>Subject-matter;</hi> (3) Its <hi>Effects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, (1) They <hi>taste</hi> of it as it is <hi>True</hi> in the Convictions they have thereof, in their Knowledge in it, and Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. This gives (as it is the Nature of Truth to doe,) some serenity and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction unto their Minds, although they are not renewed thereby. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 35. They that heard <hi>John</hi> preach the Truth, <hi>rejoyced in his Light,</hi> as finding much present satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction therein. So was it with them, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 46. and others innumerable on the like occasion of hearing our Saviour preach. When men through the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ do escape the pollutions that are in the World through lust, and them that live in Error, they <hi>taste</hi> a Goodness, a Sweetness in the Rest and Satisfaction of their Minds, so as that they suppose they are really pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of the things themselves.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) With respect unto the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Word, they have a <hi>taste</hi> of its <hi>Goodness</hi> in the Hopes which they have of their future Enjoyment. Mercy, Pardon, Life, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Glory, are all proposed in the <hi>good Word</hi> of God. These upon those
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:204232:35"/> grounds which will fail them at last, they have such hopes to be made partakers of, as that they find a great Relish and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction therein, especially when they have relief thereby against their Fears and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions. For even in those wayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they deceive themselves, they have a <hi>Taste</hi> of what Sweetness and Goodness there is in these things unto them by whom they are enjoyed. And as those who really believe and receive Jesus Christ in the Word, do thereon <hi>rejoyce with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable and full of Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. so those who only <hi>taste</hi> of the Word, do feel in themselves a great complacency in their Affections. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 20. For,</p>
               <p n="3">(3) By this <hi>Taste</hi> they may receive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Effects</hi> of the Word on their Minds and Consciences, and therein have an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Word, as unto its Power and Efficacy. It belongs unto the Exposition of the place to speak a little hereunto; and withall to declare what the difference is between them, and wherein this <hi>tasting</hi> comes short of that <hi>receiving</hi> and <hi>feeding</hi> on the Word by Faith, which is peculiar unto <hi>true</hi> Believers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This <hi>Taste</hi> is accompanyed, or it may be so, with Delight, Pleasure and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204232:36"/> in hearing of the Word preached, especially where it is dispensed by any skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Master of the Assemblyes, who findes out <hi>acceptable words,</hi> or <hi>words of delight,</hi> which yet are upright and Truth, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 10, 11. So was it with those naughty <hi>Jews, Ezek.</hi> 33. 31, 32. with <hi>Herod,</hi> who heard <hi>John</hi> the Baptist <hi>gladly,</hi> finding De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Pleasure in his Preaching. So was it with multitudes that pressed after Christ to hear the Word; and so it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it is with many in the dayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It gives not onely <hi>delight</hi> in hearing, but some <hi>Joy</hi> in the things heard. Such are the Hearers of the Word whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our compared to the <hi>Stony ground;</hi> they receive it with Joy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 20. as it was with the Hearers of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 35. The Word as <hi>tasted</hi> onely, hath this Effect on their Minds, as that they shall rejoyce in the things they hear; not with abiding solid Joy, not with <hi>Joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of Glory,</hi> but that which is temporary and evanid. And this ariseth from that Satisfaction which they find in hearing of the <hi>good things</hi> declared; such are <hi>Mercy, Pardon, Grace, Immortality</hi> and <hi>Glory;</hi> They cannot but rejoyce sometimes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:204232:36"/> at the hearing of them, though they will not be at the pains of getting an Interest in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Word onely thus <hi>tasted</hi> of, will work on men a <hi>Change</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> of their Lives, with a readiness unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of many Duties, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 20. And,</p>
               <p n="4">4. What inward <hi>Effects</hi> it may have on the <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> of men, in Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Conviction, and Humiliation, I have declared at large elsewhere. But all this while this is but <hi>tasting;</hi> The Word of the Gospel and Christ preached therein, is the <hi>food</hi> of our Souls, and true Faith doth not onely <hi>taste</hi> it, but <hi>feed</hi> upon it, whereby it is turned into Grace and spiritual Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment in the heart. And hereunto is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; (1) The <hi>laying it up,</hi> or treasuring of it in the heart, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 66. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 19. No Nourishment will ever be obtained by <hi>food,</hi> unless it be received into the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, where the Means and Causes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion and Communication are placed. And if the Word be not placed in the Heart by fixed Meditation and Delight, it may please for a season, but it will not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the Soul. (2) Food must be mixed and incorporated with the <hi>digestive</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:204232:37"/> Power, and Faculty of the Stomack, wherein soever it consists, or it will not nourish. Give a man never so much Food, if there be any noxious humour in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack hindring it from mixing it self with the Means of Digestion, it will no way profit him. And untill the Word in the Heart be mixed and incorporated with Faith, it will not advantage us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. And there is nothing hereof where there is a <hi>taste</hi> of the Word onely. (3) Where men <hi>feed</hi> on the Word, it is turned into a <hi>Principle</hi> of Life, spiritual Strength and Growth within, which a <hi>Taste</hi> of it onely will not give. As Food when it it is digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, turns into Flesh and Blood and Spirits; so doth the Word and Christ therein unto the Souls of men spiritually. Hence Christ becometh our Life, and liveth in us, as the Efficient Cause of our spiritual Life; <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 3. and we <hi>grow</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease</hi> by the Word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. A meer <hi>taste,</hi> though it may yield present Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it communicates no abiding Strength. Hence multitudes relish the Word when it is preached, but never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Life, or Srength, or Growth by it. (4) The Word received as it ought, will <hi>transform the Soul</hi> into the Likeness of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:204232:37"/> God, who sends us this Food to change our whole spiritual Constitution, and to render our Natures like unto his in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and true Holiness; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 21, 22, 23, 24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. This a <hi>Taste</hi> onely will effect nothing towards. Nor, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, will it give us such a Love of the Truth, as to abide by it in Trials or Temptations, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10. nor bring forth the Fruits of it in universal Obedience. And I might further discourse from hence of the deplorable Condition of them who satisfie their Minds in mere Notions of the Truth, and empty Speculations about it, without once attaining so much as <hi>a taste</hi> of the Goodness of the Word; of which sort there are many in the World; as also shew the Necessity which all the Hearers of the Word lye under, of a severe Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny into their own Souls, Whether they do not rest in a <hi>Taste</hi> onely of the Word, but come short of <hi>feeding</hi> upon it, and of Christ therein; but that I must not divert from the Text. What hath been here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, was needfull to declare the true State and Condition of the Persons spoken of. The Second Proposition mentioned, hath been treated of elsewhere.</p>

                  </gap>; the mighty great miraculous Operations and works of the Holy Ghost. What they were and how they were wrought among these <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> hath been declared in our Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 4. whither I referre the Reader; and they are known from the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> where sundry instances of them are recorded. I have also proved on that Chapter, that by the <hi>World to come,</hi> our Apostle in this Epistle intends the days of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that being the usual name of it in the Church at that time, as the New World which God had promised to create. Wherefore these <hi>Powers of the World to come,</hi> were the Gifts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by those Signs, Wonders, and mighty works, were then wrought by the Holy Ghost, according as it was foretold by the Prophets, that they should be so. See <hi>Joel</hi> 2. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2. These the Persons spoken of, are supposed to have <hi>tasted;</hi> for the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> foregoing. Either they had been wrought in and by themselves, or by others in their sight, whereby they had an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:204232:38"/> of the glorious and powerfull working of the Holy Ghost in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Gospel. Yea, I do judge, that themselves in their own Persons were partakers of these Powers in the <hi>Gifts of Tongues</hi> and other Miraculous Operations, which was the highest Aggravation possible of their Apostasie, and that which pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly rendred their Recovery impossible. For there is not in the Scripture an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility put upon the Recovery of any, but such as peculiarly sin against the Holy Ghost; and although that Guilt may be otherwise contracted, yet in none so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally as this of rejecting that Truth which was confirmed by his mighty Operations in them that rejected it; which could not be done without an Ascription of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power unto the Devil. Yet would I not fix on those <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively unto those that are ordinary. They also are of the <hi>Powers of the World to come.</hi> So is every thing that belongs to the Erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Preservation of the New World, or the Kingdom of Christ. To the first setting up of a Kingdom great and mighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is required; but being set up, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Dispensation of Power will preserve it: So is it in this matter. The Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:204232:39"/> miraculous Gifts of the Spirit were used in the Erection of Christs Kingdom, but it is continued by ordinary Gifts, which therefore also belong unto <hi>the Powers of the World to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the Consideration of this descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all the parts of it, we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what sort of Persons it is, that is here intended by the Apostle. And it appears, yea is evident,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Persons here intended, are not <hi>true and sincere Believers</hi> in the strict and proper sence of that name, at least they are not described here as such, so that from hence nothing can be concluded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them that are so, as to the possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their total and final Apostasie. For, (1) There is in their full and large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription no mention of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>believing,</hi> either expressely or in terms equivalent. And in no other place of the Scripture are such intended, but they are mentioned by what belongs essentially to their state. And, (2) There is not any thing ascribed to these persons, that is peculiar to them as such, or discriminative of them, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either from their especial Relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in Christ, or any such Property of their own, as is not communicable unto
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:204232:39"/> others. For instance, They are not said to be called according to Gods purpose, to be Born again not of the Will of Man, nor of the Will of the Flesh, but of God; not to be Justified, or Sanctified, or United unto Christ, or to be the Sons of God by Adoption, nor have they any other <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristical</hi> Note of true Believers ascribed to them. (3) They are in the following verses compared to the Ground on which the <hi>rain often falls, and beareth nothing but thorns and briars.</hi> But this is not so with true Believers; For Faith it self is an Herb peculiar to the enclosed Garden of Christ, and meet for him by whom we are dressed. (4) The Apostle discoursing afterwards of <hi>true Believers,</hi> doth in many particulars distinguish them from such as might be Apostates, which is supposed of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons here intended, as was in part before declared. For, 1. He ascribes unto them in general <hi>better things</hi> and such as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Salvation, as we observed, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. 2. He ascribes unto them a work and <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of love,</hi> as it is true Faith alone which worketh by Love, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. whereof he speaks not one word concerning these. 3. He asserts their Preservation, (1) On the Account of the <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:204232:40"/> of God, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. (2) Of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability</hi> of his <hi>Counsel</hi> concerning them; <hi>vers.</hi> 17, 18. In all these and sundry other Instances doth he put a difference between these Apostates and true Believers. And whereas the Apostle intends to declare the Aggravation of their Sin in falling away by the principal Priviledges whereof they were made partakers, here is not one word in Name or Thing of those which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely assigns to be the chief Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of true Believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our next Enquiry is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly whom he doth intend. And (1) they were such as not long before were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from <hi>Judaisme</hi> unto <hi>Christianity,</hi> upon the Evidence of the Truth of its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the miraculous Operations wherewith its Dispensation was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed. (2) He intends not the <hi>common sort</hi> of them but such as had obtained <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Priviledges</hi> among them. For they had received <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> of the Holy Ghost, as speaking with Tongues, or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miracles. And, (3) They had found in themselves and others convincing Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, that the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> and the <hi>Messia,</hi> which they called the <hi>World to</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:204232:40"/>
                  <hi>come,</hi> was come unto them, and had satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the gloryes of it. (4) Such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as these, as they have a work of Light on their Minds, so according unto the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of their Convictions may have such a <hi>Change</hi> wrought upon their <hi>Affections</hi> and in their Conversation, as that they may be of great esteem among Professors; and such these here intended might be. Now it must needs be some horrible frame of Spirit, some malicious Enmity against the Truth and Holiness of Christ and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, some violent love of Sin and the World, that could turn off such Persons as these from the Faith, and blot out all that Light and Conviction of Truth, which they had received. But the least Grace is a better security for Heaven than the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Gifts or Priviledges whatever.</p>
               <p>These are the Persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom our Apostle dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth, <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and of them it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by him, that they may <hi>fall away,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The especial Nature of the Sin here intended is afterwards declared in two Instances or aggravating Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. This word expresseth the respect it had to the state and Condition of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:204232:41"/> Sinners themselves; they <hi>fall away;</hi> do that whereby they do so. I think we have well expressed the word, if they <hi>shall fall away.</hi> Our old Translations rendred it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>if they shall fall,</hi> which expressed not the sence of the word, and was liable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a sence not at all intended. For he doth not say, if they shall fall into Sin, this or that or any Sin whatever that can be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; suppose the greatest sin imaginable, namely, the Denyal of Christ in the time of Danger and Persecution. This was that Sin (as we intimated before) about which so many contests were raised of old, and so many <hi>Canons</hi> were multiplyed about the ordering of them who had contracted the guilt thereof. But one Example well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, had been a better guide for them than all their own arbitrary Rules and Imaginations. For <hi>Peter</hi> fell into this sin, and yet was renewed again to Repentance, and that speedily. Wherefore, we may lay down this in the first place as to the sense of the words: There is no particular sin, that any man may fall into occasionally through the Power of Temptation, that can cast the Sinner under this Comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so that it should be impossible <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new him to Repentance.</hi> It must therefore
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:204232:41"/> (secondly,) be a <hi>Course of Sin</hi> or sinning that is intended. But there are various Degrees herein also, yea there are divers kinds of such Courses in sin. A man may so fall into a way of sin as still to retain in his Mind such a Principle of Light and Conviction that may be suitable to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. To exclude such from all hopes of Repentance, is expressely contrary to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 7. yea and the whole sence of the Scripture. Wherefore men after some Conviction and Reformation of Life, may fall into corrupt and wicked Courses and make a long abode or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in them. Examples hereof we have every day amongst us, although it may be none to parallel that of <hi>Manasse.</hi> Consider the Nature of his Education, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Father <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the greatness of his Sins, the length of his continuance in them, with his following Recovery, and he is a great Instance in this Case. Whilest there is in such Persons any seed of Light or Conviction of Truth which is capable of an Excitation or Revival, so as to put forth its Power and Efficacy in their Souls, they cannot be looked on to be in the Condition intended, though their Case be dangerous.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:204232:42"/> 3. Our Apostle makes a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, to fall <hi>absolutely;</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid;</hi> that is, absolutely and irrecoverably. So therefore doth that word signifie in this place. And <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the signification, either as to Perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Manner of the Fall, or as to Violence in the Fall it self.</p>
               <p>From what hath been discoursed, it will appear, what <hi>falling away</hi> it is that the Apostle here intendeth. And</p>
               <p n="1">(1) It is not a falling into this or that <hi>actual Sin,</hi> be it of what Nature it will, which may be, and yet not be a <hi>falling away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) It is not a Falling upon <hi>Temptation or Surprizal,</hi> for concerning such Fallings we have Rules of another kind given us in sundry places, and those exemplified in especial Instances; but it is that which is premeditated, of Deliberation and Choyce.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) It is not a Falling by Relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Renunciation of some though very
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:204232:42"/> material <hi>Principles</hi> of Christian Religion, by Error or Seduction, as the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> fell, in denying the Resurrection of the Dead, and the <hi>Galatians</hi> by denying Justification by Faith in Christ alone, Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="4">(4) It must consist in a <hi>total Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of all the constituent Principles and Doctrines of Christianity, whence it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated. Such was the Sin of them who relinquished the Gospel to return unto <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daisme</hi> as it was then stated, in opposition unto it and hatred of it. This it was, and not any kind of Actual sins that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle manifestly discourseth concerning.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) For the compleating of this Falling away according to the intention of the Apostle, it is required that this Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be <hi>avowed</hi> and professed; as, when a man forsaketh the Profession of the Gospel, and falls into <hi>Judaisme,</hi> or <hi>Mahumatisme,</hi> or <hi>Gentilisme,</hi> in Perswasion and Practice. For the Apostle discourseth concerning Faith and Obedience as <hi>professed,</hi> and so there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also of their contraryes. And this <hi>Avowment</hi> of a Relinquishment of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel hath many provoking Aggravations attending it. And yet whereas some men may in their Hearts and Minds utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:204232:43"/> the Gospel, but upon some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward secular Considerations either dare not or will not profess that inward Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their <hi>falling</hi> away is compleat and <hi>total</hi> in the sight of God; and all they do to cover their Apostasie in an external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with Christian Religion, is in the sight of God but a mocking of him, and the highest Aggravation of their sin.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>falling away</hi> intended by the Apostle; A voluntary resolved Relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, and Apostasie from the Gospel, the Faith, Rule, and Obedience thereof, which cannot be without casting the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Reproach and Contumely imaginable upon the Person of Christ himself, as it is afterwards expressed.</p>
               <p>Concerning these Persons and their thus <hi>falling away,</hi> two things are to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Text. (1) <hi>What is affirmed of them.</hi> (2) <hi>The Reason of that Affirmation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is; <hi>That it is impossible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them again unto Repentance.</hi> The thing intended is <hi>Negative;</hi> to renew them again to Repentance, this is denyed of them; but the Modification of that <hi>Negation</hi> turns the Proposition into an <hi>Affirmation; It is Impossible so to doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:204232:43"/>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Importance of this word is dubious; some think <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> an <hi>absolute,</hi> and others onely a <hi>moral</hi> Impossibility is intended therby. This latter most fix upon, so that it is a matter rare, difficult, and seldom to be expected, that is intended, and not that which is <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely</hi> impossible. Considerable Reasons and Instances are produced for either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. But we must look further into the meaning of it.</p>
               <p>All future Events depend on God, who alone doth necessarily exist. Other things <hi>may be</hi> or <hi>may not be</hi> as they respect him or his Will. And so things that are future may be said to be <hi>impossible,</hi> or be so, either with respect unto the Nature of God, or his Decrees, or his Moral Rule, Order and Law. Things are impossible with respect unto the Nature of God, either absolutely as being inconsistent with his Being and Essential Properties; so it is <hi>impossible that God should lye:</hi> Or on some Supposition; so it is <hi>impossible</hi> that God should <hi>forgive sin without satisfaction,</hi> on the supposition of his Law, and the Sanction of it. In this sence the Repentance of these Apostates <hi>it may be</hi> is not impossible. I say, <hi>it may be;</hi> It may be there is nothing in it contrary to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:204232:44"/> any Essential Properties of the Nature of God, either directly or reductively. But I will not be positive herein. For the things ascribed unto these Apostates are such, namely, <hi>their crucifying the Son of God afresh, and putting him to open shame,</hi> as that I know not but that it may be contrary to the Holiness and Righteousness and Glory of God as the Supreme Ruler of the World, to have any more Mercy on them than on the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves, or those that are in Hell. But I will not assert this to be the meaning of the place.</p>
               <p>Again, things <hi>possible</hi> in themselves, and with respect unto the Nature of God, are rendred <hi>impossible</hi> by Gods <hi>Decree</hi> and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; he hath absolutely determined, that they shall never be. So it was impossible that <hi>Saul</hi> and his Posterity should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the Kingdom of <hi>Israel.</hi> It was not contrary to the Nature of God, but God had decreed that so it should not be, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 28, 29. But the Decrees of God respecting Persons in particular, and not <hi>Qualifications</hi> in the first place, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be here intended; because they are free Acts of his Will, not revealed neither in particular, nor by vertue of any gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule, as they are Soveraign Acts making
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:204232:44"/> differences between Persons in the same Condition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11, 12. What is possible or impossible with respect unto the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, we may know in some good measure from the certain Knowledge we may have of his Being and Essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. But what is so one way or other with respect unto his Decrees or Purposes, which are Soveraign free Acts of his Will, knoweth no man, not the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 34.</p>
               <p>3<seg rend="sup">dly</seg>, Things are <hi>possible</hi> or <hi>impossible</hi> with respect unto the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of all things that God hath appointed. When in things of Duty God hath neither expressely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, nor appointed Means for the Performance of them, then are we to look upon them as <hi>impossible,</hi> and then with respect unto us they are so absolutely and so to be esteemed. And this is the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility here principally intended. It is a thing that God hath neither commanded us to endeavour, nor appointed means to attain it, nor promised to assist us in it. It is therefore that which we have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to look after, attempt or expect, as being not possible by any Law, Rule, or Constitution of God.</p>
               <p>The Apostle instructs us no further in the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:204232:45"/> Nature of future Events, but as our own Duty is concerned in them. It is not for us either to look, or hope, or pray for, or endeavour the Renewal of such Persons unto Repentance. God gives Law unto us in these things, not unto himself. It may be possible with God for ought we know, if there be not a Contradiction in it unto any holy Properties of his Nature; Only he will not have us to expect any such things from him, nor hath he appointed any Means for us to endeavour it. What he shall doe we ought thankfully to accept; but our own Duty towards such Persons is absolutely at an End. And indeed they put themselves wholly out of our reach.</p>

                     </gap>.</note> unto him. For as we had lost the Image of God by sin, and were separated from him as things Prophane, this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> respects both the Restauration of our Nature and the Dedication of our Persons to God; And it is two-fold.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Internal</hi> in Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and effectual Sanctification. <hi>The washing of Regeneration and the renewing of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 23. But this is not that which is here intended. For this these Apostates never had, and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to be <hi>renewed again</hi> unto it.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:204232:46"/> For no man can be renewed again unto that which he never had.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is <hi>outward</hi> in the <hi>Profession</hi> and Pledge of it. Wherefore Renovation in this sence consists in the solemn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith and Repentance by Jesus Christ, with the Seal of Baptism received thereon. For thus it was with all those who were converted unto the Gospel. Upon their Profession of Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, they received the Baptismal Pledge of an inward Renovation though really they were not partakers thereof. But this Estate was their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; their Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From this state they fell totally, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing <hi>Him</hi> who is the Author of it, his <hi>Grace</hi> which is the Cause of it, and the <hi>Ordinance</hi> which is the Pledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears what it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to renew them again.</hi> It is to bring them again into this state of Profession by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Renovation, and a second Baptisme as a Pledge thereof. This is determined impossible, and so unwarrantable for any to attempt. And for the most part such Persons do openly fall into such Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against, and engage (if they have Power) into such Persecution of the Truth,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:204232:46"/> as that they give themselves sufficient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection how others should behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves towards them. So the Ancient Church was satisfied in the Case of <hi>Julian.</hi> This is the summe of what is affirmed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Apostates, namely, That it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to renew them unto Repentance; that is, so to act towards them as to bring them to that Repentance whereby they may be enstated in their former Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Hence sundry things may be observed for the clearing of the Apostles design in this Discourse. As,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Here is nothing said concerning the Acceptance or Refusal of <hi>any upon Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> or the Professon thereof after any sin, to be made by the Church, whose Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be determined by other Rules and Circumstances. And this perfectly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the pretence of the <hi>Novatians</hi> from any countenance in these words. For whereas they would have drawn their warranty from hence for the utter Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from Church Communion of all those who had denyed the Faith in times of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, although they expressed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance whose sincerity they could not evince; Those onely are intended, who
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:204232:47"/> neither do, nor can come to Repentance it self, nor make a Profession of it, with whom the Church had no more to doe. It is not said that men who ever thus fell away, shall not upon their Repentance be admitted again into their former state in the Church; But that such is the severity of God against them that he will not again give them Repentance unto Life.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Here is nothing that may be brought in barr against such as having fallen by any <hi>great Sin,</hi> or any Course in sinning, and that after Light, Convictions, and Gifts received and exercised, who desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their Sins and endeavour after Sincerity therein. Yea such a desire and endeavour exempts any one from the Judgement here threatned.</p>
               <p>There is therefore in it that which tends greatly to the Encouragement of such Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For, whereas it is here declared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those who are thus rejected of God, that it is impossible to <hi>renew them,</hi> or to do any thing towards them that shall have a tendency unto Repentance; those who are not satisfied that they do yet savingly Repent, but only are sincerely exercised how they may attain thereunto, have no concernment in this Commination;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:204232:47"/> but evidently have the Door of Mercy still opened unto them. For it is shut only against those who shall never endeavour to turn by Repentance. And although persons so rejected of God, may fall under Convictions of their Sin attended with despair, which is unto them a foresight of their future Condition; yet as unto the least attempt after Repentance on the terms of the Gospel, they do never rise up unto it. Wherefore the <hi>Impossibility</hi> intended of what sort soever it be, respects the severity of God, not in refusing or rejecting the greatest sinners which seek after and would be renewed unto Repentance, which is contrary unto innumerable of his Promises; but in the giving up such Sinners as these are here mentioned unto that obdurateness and obstinacy in sinning, that blindness of Mind, and hardness of Heart, as that they neither will nor shall ever sincerely seek after Repentance, nor may any means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mind of God be used to bring them thereunto. And the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the exercise of this Severity is taken from the Nature of this Sin or what is contained in it, which the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in the ensuing Instances. And we may in our passage, observe, That</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:204232:48"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the preaching of the Gospel, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to propose unto men, and to insist on the Severity of God, in dealing with provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Sinners against it.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity</hi> of God is principally though not solely exercised with respect unto sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gospel. This our Apostle calls us to the consideration of, in the case of the unbelieving <hi>Jews. Rom.</hi> 11. 22. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Behold the goodnesse and severity of God; towards them that fell,</hi> (those in the Text) <hi>severity.</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is a sharp Dissecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or cutting off. I do not therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by it an essential Property of the Nature of God. It is not the same with his Holiness, Righteousness, or vindictive Justice. These are essential Properties of the Divine Nature, whence it is that he neither will nor can absolutely suffer men to sin, and let them go for ever unpunished without any Satisfaction or Attonement made for their sins, whereof we have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed elsewhere. But by Gods <hi>Severity</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the free Act of his Will, acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto those Properties of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in an eminent manner, when and how he pleaseth. And therefore into them it is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:204232:48"/> resolved. So our Apostle when he would intimate this <hi>Severity</hi> unto us to ingenerate in us a holy Fear and Reverence of God in his Worship, addes as his Motive, <hi>for our God is a consuming fire, Heb.</hi> 12. 29. That is, of an infinitely pure, holy, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nature, according to which he will deal with us, and so may unexpectedly break forth upon us in <hi>Severity</hi> if we labour not for Grace to serve him acceptably with Reverence and godly Fear. Wherefore this Severity of God is his exemplary deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with provoking Sinners according to the exigence of his Holiness and Wisdom, without an Interposition of longer Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Forbearance. There are some sins or degrees in sinning, that neither the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, nor Majesty, nor Wisdom of God can so bear withall, as to suffer them to pass unpunished or unremarked on in this world. In such cases is God said to exercise his <hi>Severity.</hi> And he doth so,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) In extraordinary <hi>outward Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> upon open prosligate Sinners, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Enemies of his Church and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Hence on such an occasion doth God give that description of himself; <hi>Nahum</hi> 1. 2. <hi>God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth, the Lord revengeth and is furious; the Lord</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:204232:49"/>
                  <hi>will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his Enemies.</hi> When God acteth towards his Adversaries ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Description here given of himself, he deals with them in <hi>Severity.</hi> And two things are required to make these Judgements of God against his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this world to be Instances thereof. (1) That they be <hi>unusual,</hi> such as do not commonly and frequently fall out in the ordinary dispensation of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 29, 30. God doth not in the Government of the World suffer any thing to fall out or come to pass that in the issue shall be contrary to his Justice, or inconsistent with his Righteousness. But yet he beareth with things so for the most part, as that he will manifest himself to be exceedingly full of Patience and Long-suffering, as also to exercise the Faith of them that believe in the Expectation of a future Judgement. Wherefore there must be somewhat <hi>extraordinary</hi> in those Judgements wherein God will exercise and manifest <hi>Severity.</hi> So it is expressed; <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 21. <hi>The Lord shall rise up as in Mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may doe his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:204232:49"/>
                  <hi>strange act.</hi> The Work he will doe is <hi>his</hi> Work, but it is his <hi>strange</hi> Work; that is, not strange from or opposite unto his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for so he will do nothing; but that which is <hi>unusual,</hi> which he doth but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and is therefore marvellous. Thus in sudden destructions of Persecutors or Persons of a flagitious wickedness, in great Desolations of provoking Families, Cities and Nations, in Fire from Heaven, in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations, Plagues, Earthquakes, and such sudden extraordinary consuming Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, God giveth Instances of his <hi>Severity</hi> in the world; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. (2) In this case it is required that such Judgements be <hi>open, visible,</hi> and manifest both unto those who are punished, and to others who wisely consider them. So God speaketh of himself; <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>God that repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them; he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face:</hi> That is, he will do it openly and manifestly, that themselves and all others shall take notice of his <hi>severity</hi> therein. This I say is one way whereby God acts his <hi>Severity</hi> in this world. And hereby he poureth everlasting contempt upon the security of his proudest and haughtiest Adversaries. For when they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:204232:50"/> think they have sufficiently provided for their own safety, and stopped all <hi>Avenues</hi> of Evil according to the Rules of their Policy and Wisdom with the best Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations they are able to make of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary effects of his Providence, and so give up themselves to take satisfaction in their Lusts and Pleasures, He breaks in upon them with an Instance and Example of his severity to their utter destruction. So when they say, <hi>Peace and Safety, then sudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with childe, and they shall not escape,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 3. This will be the state one day of the whole <hi>Babylonish</hi> interest in the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 7, 9. But this is not directly intended in this place; although even this effect of Gods <hi>Severity</hi> overtook these Apostates afterwards.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) In <hi>spiritual Judgements.</hi> By these God in his <hi>Severity</hi> leaveth unprofitable, provoking, and Apostate Professors under the impossibility here intended of being renewed unto repentance. And this is the sorest of all Gods Judgements. There is in it a sentence of Eternal Damnation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on men afore-hand in this world. So our Apostle tells us, <hi>Some mens sins are open beforehand, going before to judgement;</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:204232:50"/> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 24: God so passeth judgement concerning them in this world, as that there shall be no Alteration in their State and Condition to Eternity. And this <hi>severity</hi> of God towards Sinners under the Gospel, shutting them up under final Impenitency, consists in these four things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) God puts an end unto all his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> concerning them; He looks for no more from them, and so exerciseth no more care about them. Whilest God is pleased to afford the use of Means for Conversion and Repentance unto any, he is said to <hi>look for and expect</hi> answerable Fruits; I did (saith he) so to my Vineyard, <hi>and I looked</hi> that it should bring forth Grapes; <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 2, 4. Wherefore when God takes away all Means of Grace and Repentance from any, then he puts an End unto his own Expectation of any Fruits. For if a man can have no Fruit from his Vineyard whilest he dresseth it, or his Field whilest he tilleth it, he will never look for any after he hath given them up and laid them waste. And on the other side, when he utterly ceaseth to look for any Fruit from them, he will <hi>till</hi> them no more; for why should he put himself to charge or trouble to no purpose? Wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:204232:51"/> the Souls of men when God in this sence <hi>looks for</hi> no more at their hands; that is, when he puts an end unto that Patience or Long-suffering towards them from whence all supplyes of the Means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Repentance doe arise and spring. This God doth by some, and that in such wayes as we shall afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) God will actually punish them with, or inflict on them <hi>Hardness of Heart</hi> and Blindness of Mind, that they never shall Repent or Believe. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 39, 40. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not Believe, because Esaias said again, He hath blinded their Eyes, and hardned their Heart, that they should not see with their Eyes, nor understand with their Heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</hi> God will now Judicially blind them and harden them, and by one Means or other every thing that befalls them shall promote their Induration. So it was with these <hi>Jews;</hi> The Doctrine of Christ filled them with Envy, his Holiness with Malice, and his Miracles with Rage and Madness. Their <hi>Table was a Snare</hi> to them, and that which should have been for their good turned to their hurt. So is it with all them whom God in his <hi>Severity</hi> hardeneth. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:204232:51"/> the outward Means be continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them or no, all is one, every thing shall drive them farther from God and increase their Obstinacy against him. From hence they become <hi>Scoffers</hi> and <hi>Persecutors</hi> avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly scorning and hating the Truth. And herein it may be they shall please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves untill they are swallowed up in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair or the Grave.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) God usually in his <hi>Severity</hi> gives them up unto <hi>sensual Lusts.</hi> So he dealt with the Idolaters of old; He <hi>gave them up to vile affections, Rom.</hi> 1. 26. such as those there described by the Apostle; and in the pursuit of them, <hi>gave them over to a reprobate Mind, to do the things that are not convenient,</hi> ver. 28. Whence they were <hi>filled with all unrighteousness,</hi> ver. 29. So doth God frequently deal with Apostates from the Gospel, or from the principal Truths of it, unto Idolatry and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And when they are engaged in the pursuit of these Lusts, especially when they are Judicially given up unto them, they are held assuredly as under Cords and Chains unto final Impenitency.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) God gives such Persons up unto <hi>Sathan</hi> to be blinded, and lead by him into pernicious Delusions. <hi>Because they received</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:204232:52"/>
                  <hi>not the love of the Truth, that they might be saved, God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lye; that they all might be damned who loved not the Truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness,</hi> 2 Thess. 2. 10, 11, 12. This was the State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Persons here prophesied of: The Truth of the Gospel was preached unto them, and for some time professed by them. They received the Truth, but they received not the <hi>Love</hi> of it, so as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it and improve it unto its proper End. This kept them barren and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table under their Profession. For where the Truth is not <hi>loved</hi> as well as <hi>believed</hi> or assented unto, it will bring forth no Fruits. But this was not all; They had <hi>pleasure in their sins,</hi> lusts, and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, resolving not to part with them on any terms. Whereas therefore these are all of them absolutely and without Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation judged and condemned by the Truth of the Gospel, they began to dislike and secretly to hate the Truth it self. But whereas together with their lusts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness wherein they had pleasure, they found a Necessity of a Religion one or other, or the pretence of some Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or other to give them countenance
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:204232:52"/> against the Truth which they rejected, they were in a readiness to any thing that should offer it self unto them. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the way of Punishment, and as a Revenge of their horrible Ingratitude and Contempt of his Gospel, God gives them up to the Power of Sathan, who blindes, deludes, and deceives them with such Efficacy, as that they shall not onely readily embrace, but obstinately believe and adhere to the Lyes, Errours and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods that he shall suggest unto them. And this is the way and course whereby so many carnal Gospellers are turned off unto <hi>Romish</hi> Idolatry every day.</p>
               <p>Other Instances of the <hi>Severity</hi> of God on this Occasion might be given; but these are fully sufficient to declare the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his dealing with such as those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the Text, whence it follows, that their Renovation unto Repentance is <hi>impossible.</hi> For what hopes or expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should we have concerning such as God hath utterly forsaken, whom he hath judicially smitten with Blindness and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Heart, whom he hath given up not only to the Power and Efficacy of their own Lusts and vile Affections, but also immediately unto Sathan to be deluded,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:204232:53"/> and lead captive at his pleasure? In vain shall the Repentance of such Persons be either expected or endeavoured.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Severity</hi> of God ought to be preached and insisted on in the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel. Let the Reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult what hath been already offered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the use of Gospel <hi>Threatnings</hi> and Comminations, on the Third and Fourth Chapters. There is a proneness in corrupted Nature to despise the Riches of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Forbearance and Long-suffering of God, not knowing that the Goodness of God leadeth them to Repentance, and thereon after their hardness and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent heart treasure up to themselves wrath against the day of wrath, as our Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5. Considering nothing in God but Mercy and Long-suffering, and nothing in the Gospel but Grace and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, they are ready to despise and turn them into Lasciviousness, or from them both to countenance themselves in their sins. By this Means, on such mistaken Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, suited to their Lusts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Inclinations, heightened by the craft of Sathan, do multitudes under the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel harden themselves daily to Destruction. And others there are, who
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:204232:53"/> although they will not on such wicked pretences give up themselves to their Lusts and carnal Affections, yet for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Vigilancy and watchfulness, are apt to have Sloth and Negligence with many ill Frames of Spirit to increase and grow upon them. Both sorts are to be stirred up by being put in mind of this <hi>Severity</hi> of God. They are to be taught that there are secret Powers accompanying the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Gospel, continually in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to <hi>revenge all disobedience;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6. That God is not mocked, but <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever a man soweth, that he shall also reap. For he that soweth to the Flesh, of the Flesh shall reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting; Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8. But I have elsewhere already shewed the Necessity there was of arming the Gospel with Threatnings, as well as confirming of it with Promises, so as that it may not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Expos.</hi> Heb. Chap. 4. 1, 2.</note> be here again at large insisted on.</p>
               <p>From what hath been discoursed, it is evident how necessary and wholsome a Warning or Threatning is here expressed by the Apostle. It is the open Mistakes of men that have drawn undue Entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:204232:54"/> out of it; In it self it is both plain and necessary. Shall we be afraid to say, that God will not renew such Sinners as those before described unto Rpentance? or to declare unto sinners, that without Repentance they cannot be saved? or shall we Preach to men, that whatever Light they have had, whatever Gifts they have received, whatever Priviledges they have been made partakers of; whatever Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession they have made, or for how long a season soever; if they fall totally and despightfully from the Gospel into that which is most opposite both to its Truth and Holiness, yet there is no doubt, but they may again repent and be saved? God forbid so great a wickedness should fall from our Mouths. Nay, we are to warn all Persons in danger of such Apostasies, that if any one so draw back, Gods Soul will have no pleasure in him; that it is a <hi>fearfull thing</hi> to fall into the hands of the Living God; that he will harden such Sinners, and give them up to strong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that they may be damned; that he is not under the ingagement of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to give them Repentance, but hath rather given many severe Threatnings to the contrary. He hath told us, that such
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:204232:54"/> Persons are as <hi>Trees twice dead,</hi> plucked up by the roots, of which there is no hope, that denying the Lord that bought them; they bring on themselves swift destruction, whose Damnation slumbreth not, with the like Declarations of <hi>Severity</hi> against them innumerable.</p>
               <p>But what shall be said unto them, who having through great Temptations, and it may be Fears and Surprizals, for a season renounced the Gospel; or such as by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of great sins against Light, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding in Profession, do apprehend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be fallen into this Condition, and yet are greatly desirous of a Recovery, and do crye to God for Repentance and Acceptance? I answer as before, they are not at all concerned in this Text. Here is nothing excluding them from Acceptance with God and Eternal Salvation, be they who or what they will that seek it by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; onely there are some who are excluded by God, and do obstinately shut up themselves from all Endeavours after Repentance it self, with whom we have not any thing to doe.</p>
               <p>It is true, those alone are here firstly and directly intended, who in those dayes had received <hi>extraordinary</hi> or Miraculous Gifts
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:204232:55"/> of the Holy Ghost. But this by just <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> may be extended unto others, now those Gifts are ceased in the Church. For those Gifts and Priviledges which are yet continued unto men do lay (in present cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances) the same Obligation upon them unto Perseverance in Profession, and give the same Aggravation unto their Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, as did those extraordinary Gifts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly conferr'd upon Profession. Let us not then be high-minded but fear. It is not good approaching too neer a Precipice.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:204232:55"/> Renew them. It is impossible that any should renew them to Repentance; For this cannot be done <hi>without crucifying the Son of God again,</hi> since these Apostates have utterly rejected all Interest in, and Benefit by his Death as once undergone for Sinners. This none can doe; we ought not, we <hi>cannot crucifie Christ again,</hi> that they may be renewed and saved. Who can entertain a thought tending towards a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that so it might be? And this sence in the same or an alike Case the Apostle plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expresseth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 26, 27. <hi>If we sin wilfully after we have received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for sin.</hi> Christ cannot be offered again, and so crucified again, without which the sins of such Persons cannot be expiated. For the unbloody Sacrificing of Christ every day in the <hi>Masse</hi> was not as yet invented; and it is a Relief fit onely for them to trust unto, who have no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in that Sacrifice which he offered once for all. But there is in that other place an allusion to the Sacrifices under the Law. Because they could legally expiate no sins but what were past before their Offering, they were to be frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated upon reiterated sinning. So from
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:204232:56"/> time to time they sinned, (as no man liveth and sinneth not,) and had Sacrifices renewed for their sins, applyed unto the particular sins they had committed. This could now be so no more, Christ being once offered for Sin▪ whoever loseth his Interest in that one Offering, and forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Benefit of it, there is no more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for him; Christ henceforth dieth no more. It cannot be hence imagined that the Grace of the Gospel is restrained, as being all confined unto that one Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, from what was represented in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed Sacrifices of the Law.</p>
               <p>For, (1) The <hi>one</hi> Sacrifice of Christ, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended farther as to Sins and Persons, than <hi>all</hi> those of the Law with all their Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions put together. <hi>By him all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are justified from those things which they could not be justified from by the Law of Moses, Acts</hi> 13. 39. There were some sins under the Law for which no Sacrifice was provided, seeing he who was guilty of them was to dye without Mercy; as in the Cases of Murder and Adultery, with respect whereunto <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Thou desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest not Sacrifice else would I give it, thou delightest not in Burnt-offering, Psal.</hi> 51. 16. namely in such Cases as his then was.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:204232:56"/>
               <p> But, (2) In case of <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the one and the other, the <hi>Event</hi> was the same. There was under the Law no Sacrifice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for him who had <hi>totally Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> from its Fundamental Principles, or sinned <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>presumptuously,</hi> with an hand high and stubborn. This was that despising of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, for which those that were guilty thereof, <hi>were to dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy, Heb.</hi> 10. 28. And so it is under the Gospel. Wilfull Apostates forfeiting all their Interest in the Sacrifice of Christ, there is no Relief appointed for them, but God will cut them off and destroy them; as shall God willing be declared on that place. And this may be the sence of the words, supposing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not to belong ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally unto this place. God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined all hopes of Mercy Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the <hi>one single Offering</hi> and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> This our Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth on and presseth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 12, 14.

And this <hi>one Offering</hi> of his is so sufficient and effectually powerfull unto all that by Faith seek an Interest therein, that this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:204232:57"/> restraint is no restraint; nor hath any Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the least cause to complain of it. If they reject and despise it, it is their own fault, and at their own Peril. Nor is it the reiterated Sacrifice of the <hi>Masse,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else they may betake themselves unto, that will afford them any relief.</p>
               <p>But the word is constant enough in ancient <hi>Copyes</hi> to maintain its <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> own station, and the context requires its continuance. And this makes the work of <hi>crucifying again,</hi> to be the act of the Apostates themselves, and to be <hi>asserted,</hi> as that which belongs unto <hi>their sin,</hi> and not <hi>denyed</hi> as belonging to a <hi>Relief</hi> from their Sin. They <hi>crucifie him again to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> They doe it not really, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do so; but they do it <hi>to themselves</hi> Morally. This is in their sin of falling away, part of it comprized in it, which renders it unpardonable; they again cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the Son of God, not absolutely, but in and to themselves.</p>
               <p>And we must inquire how they did it, or in what sence it is by the Apostle charged on them. Now this (to omit all other things that may be thought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre herein) was,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Principally by an <hi>Accession in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:204232:57"/> unto them who had crucified him once before. Hereby they went over the same work with them, and did that for their own parts, which the others had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for theirs. They approved of and justified the fact of the <hi>Jews</hi> in crucifying him as a Malefactor. For there is no <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> between these things. The Lord Christ must be esteemed to be the Son of God, and consequently his Gospel to be indispensably obeyed, or be supposed to be justly crucified, as a Seducer, a Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer and a Malefactor. For Professing himself to be the Son of God, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing that Confession unto his Death, he must be so received or rejected as an evil doer. And this was done by these <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states;</hi> for, going over to the <hi>Jews</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of what they had done in crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him as such a one.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) They did it by declaring that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made trial of <hi>him</hi> his <hi>Gospel</hi> and wayes, they found nothing of <hi>Substance</hi> Truth or Goodness in them, for which they should continue their Profession. Thus that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous or infamous Apostate <hi>Julian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour gave this as the Motto of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I have read, known and condemned</hi> your Gospel. And
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:204232:58"/> this hath been the way of Apostates in all Ages. In the Primitive times they were the <hi>Gentiles Intelligencers,</hi> and like the Spyes of old brought up a false Report upon the Land. For they were not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (for the most part) to declare their disapprobation of what was really taught believed and practised among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but the more to countenance their <hi>Apostasie,</hi> not only invidiously represented and odiously traduced what was really professed, but withall invented Lyes and Calumnies about Conspiracies, Seditions, and Inconsistencyes with publick Peace among them, so if it were possible, to ruine the whole Interest and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto it. This is to crucifie Christ afresh, and to put him to open shame. And such is the manner of them unto this day. If any have made an Accession to the more intimate Duties of Religion, as Prayer and Preaching by vertue of spiritual Gifts with other Acts of mutual spiritual Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the generality of men concern not themselves in; when in complyance with their Occasions and Temptations they fall from them and renounce them; they aim at nothing more than by malicious scurrilous Representations of them, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:204232:58"/> false Additions unto them of things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse or ridiculous, to expose them to open shame and ignominy. Their language is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; <hi>We have known and tryed these things, and declare their folly;</hi> so hoping to be believed, because of their pretended Experience, which alone is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to render them suspected with all Persons of Wisdom and Sobriety. Now no man living can attempt an higher disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour against Jesus Christ, in his Person, or in any of his wayes, than openly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that upon Trial of them, they find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them for which they should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired. But it had been better for such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>not to have known the way of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, than after they have known it, to turn aside from the holy Commandment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the first Aggravation of the sins mentioned, taken from the Act ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto the Sinners; They <hi>crucifie him again,</hi> they do it as much as in them lyeth, and declare that they <note place="margin">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:204232:59"/> they did, not when he had emptyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and made himself of no Reputation, so that it was not an easie matter to look thorough all the veyls of his outward Weakness and Condition in this world, to behold <hi>his Glory, as the Glory of the onely Begotten of the Father,</hi> in which state he was crucified by the <hi>Jews;</hi> but now when he had been declared to be <hi>the Son of God with Power, according to the Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by the Resurrection from the dead,</hi> and his Divinity was variously attested unto in the world, and among themselves; And this is the great Aggravation of sin against the Gospel, namely, of Unbelief; that it is immediately against <hi>the Son of God.</hi> His Person is despised in it, both Absolutely and in the Discharge of all his Offices. And therefore is God himself so, because he hath nothing to do with us but by his Son.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Apostle addes as another Aggravation of their Sin, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>exposing him again to publick ignominy or shame.</hi>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:204232:59"/> The word is but once more used in the New Testament, namely, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 19. where it is spoken of <hi>Joseph</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto his Espoused Wife the Holy Virgin; <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>According unto this sence our Apostle expressing the Death of Christ as inflicted by men, reduces the Evils that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed it unto two heads: (1) The <hi>Pain</hi> of it, and (2) The <hi>Shame;</hi> Chap. 12. 2. <hi>He endured the Cross and despised the Shame.</hi> For as the Death of the Cross was <hi>poenal,</hi> or painfull and dolorous, so in the manner of it in all its Circumstances of Time, Place, Person, it was most highly <hi>shamefull.</hi> He was in it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ignominiously tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,</hi> or put to open shame; yea, the Death of the Cross amongst all people was peculiarly <hi>shamefull.</hi> Thus in calling over his Death in this place, he referres it unto the same heads of <hi>Suffering</hi> and <hi>Shame; crucifying</hi> him, and putting him to open <hi>shame.</hi> And in this latter he was not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by these Apostates no more than in the former, so far as it lay in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:204232:60"/>
               <p> And hence we may raise a sufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer unto an <hi>Objection</hi> of no small impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that ariseth against our Exposition of this place. For it may be said, <hi>That if those, or many of them, or any of them, who actually and</hi> really crucified <hi>the Son of God in his own Person, and put him to open shame, did yet obtain Mercy and Pardon of that and all other Sins, as it is confessed they did; Whence is it that those who renounce him, and do so crucifie him and put him to shame only</hi> Metaphorically <hi>and to themselves, should be excluded from all hopes of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Pardon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, That the sin of those who forsake Christ and the Gospel after their Conviction of its Truth, and Profession of it, is on many Accounts far greater than that of those who Crucified him in the dayes of his Flesh: And there are sundry Reasons whereon God will exercise more <hi>Severity</hi> towards this latter sort of sinners than towards the former.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The Sin is greater, because no way to be extenuated by <hi>Ignorance.</hi> This is every where allowed, as that which made the Sin of Crucifying of Christ <hi>pardonable</hi> upon their Repentance, and their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <hi>possible.</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> in his Sermon to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:204232:60"/> them, layes down this as the Foundation of his Exhortation unto Repentance. <hi>And now Brethren, I wot that through Ignorance you did it, as did also your Rulers, Act.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Had they known it, they would not have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. which our Apostle pleads also in his own Case, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. This put their sins among the number of those which Sacrifices were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for of old, and which fell under the care of him who knows how to have compassion on the <hi>ignorant,</hi> and them that are out of the way.</p>
               <p>But it may be enquired, <hi>How</hi> They <hi>could be excused by Ignorance, who had so many Means and Evidences of Conviction as to the Truth of his Person, that he was the Messiah; and of his Doctrine, that it was from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? For besides the concurrent Testimony of</hi> Moses <hi>and the</hi> Prophets <hi>given unto him, the Holiness of his Person and Life, the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his Doctrine, and the Evidence of his Miracles, did abundantly prove and confirm the Truth of those things; so that they could be no otherwise Ignorant but by wilfull Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. These were indeed such Means of Conviction, as that their Sin and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief against them had no <hi>real Excuse;</hi> as
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:204232:61"/> himself every where expresseth; <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 47, 48. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 36, 37, 38. 2. Nothing is allowed unto this Ignorance, but that it left their Repentance <hi>possible,</hi> and their Sin <hi>pardonable.</hi> 3. This it will doe, untill God hath used <hi>all the Means</hi> of Conviction which he intendeth, and no longer. This as yet he had not done. He had yet two farther Testimonyes unto the Truth, which he would graciously afford. (1.) His <hi>Resurrection</hi> from the Dead; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. which was alwayes afterwards plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the principal Evidence of Gods Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of him. (2.) The <hi>Effusion</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in his Miraculous Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 32, 33. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 32. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. But where at any time God hath granted all the Means of Conviction that he pleaseth, be they Ordinary or Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, if they are rejected, there is no hope, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29, 30, 31. On the other side, this Sin of Rejecting Christ and the Gospel after Profession is absolutely <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> and with an high hand, against all the Light and Conviction that God will give of the Truth unto any of the Children of Men in this World.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) These Persons had an <hi>Experience</hi> of the Truth, Goodness and Excellency of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:204232:61"/> Gospel, which those others had not, nor could have; For they had <hi>tasted of the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come,</hi> and had received great Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the things they were convinced of, as was before at large declared. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their Rejection of him and them, an unconquerable Hatred and Malice must be granted to be predominant. And let men take heed what they do when they begin to sin against their own <hi>Experience,</hi> for Evil lyes at the door.</p>
               <p>(3<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>,) In and under the <hi>crucifying</hi> of the Lord Christ, God had yet a <hi>Design</hi> of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace to be communicated unto Men by the Dispensation of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> Therefore there was a way set open unto those who were guilty of that Sin, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Pardon. But now having made use of this also, that being sinned against, there is no place left for any thing but <hi>Severity.</hi> Wherefore,</p>
               <p>(4<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>,) There was in the Sin of these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost.</hi> For they had received in themselves, or seen in others, those mighty Operations of his whereby he gave Attestation unto Christ and the Gospel. Therefore they could not renounce the Lord Christ, without an
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:204232:62"/> Ascription of these Works of the Holy Ghost unto the Devil, which the Devil acted them unto. So saith our Apostle; <hi>No man speaking by the Holy Ghost, calleth Jesus Anathema, or</hi> Accursed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. To call him <hi>Anathema,</hi> is to declare and avow that he was justly crucified as an Accursed Person, as a publick Pest. This was done by these Persons who went over to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in Approbation of what they had done against him. This no man can doe speaking by the Holy Ghost. That is, whosoever doth so, is acted by the spirit of the Devil; And if he have known the Testimony of the Holy Spirit to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he doth it in despight of Him, which renders the Sin irremissible.</p>

It were well for such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons if their Guilt had no other Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than theirs who actually <hi>with wicked hands slew him, and hanged him on a Tree.</hi> But rising up unto a Contempt of all the Means of Conviction and Evidences of Truth that God will grant us in this world, they cast themselves without that Line of Divine Mercy and Pardon, which some of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:204232:63"/> the others were encompassed withall. So is it with many at this day in the world; who with wicked Hearts and blinded Minds in the pursuit of carnal Lusts, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and obstinately embrace <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metisme,</hi> with an open Renunciation of Christ and the Gospel. Unto such Persons there is nothing left but a <hi>fearfull Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Judgement and fiery Indignation that shall consume the Adversaries.</hi> Not that I would cast all Persons who may be actually hurried into this Abomination under the same dreadfull Doom, seeing the case in general will admit of many circumstantial differences, if not altering the Nature of the Crime, yet disposing of things unto various Events. Not onely Surprizals by mighty Temptations with dread and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, so shaking the Powers of Nature, as to intercept the influence of Light and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of Truth, do claim an Exemption from a decretory Determination under this Sentence; but other Cases may also be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with some such alleviating Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as preserving their Minds and Souls from <hi>wilfull Malice,</hi> leave room for the exercise of Soveraign Grace. I my self knew one, yea was conversant with him, and assisting of him in the Concerns of his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:204232:63"/> Soul, who in the <hi>Indies</hi> turned <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> was actually initiated by Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into their Superstition, and lived in its outward Practice a year or two; who yet was sincerely recovered unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and died in the Faith of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partial Apostasie,</hi> is every Crime against the Gospel which partakes of the Nature of the other in any Measure or Degree. And whatever doth so, makes an Accession towards the Guilt of <hi>crucifying the Son of God afresh, and putting him unto open shame.</hi> For it is in his Gospel and Church alone wherein he can now suffer from the Sons of men. When any important Principle of Evangelical Truth is forsaken and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, especially when Many of them are so; when the Rule of Obedience which the Gospel prescribeth is habitually neglected, when men Believe otherwise than it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and Live otherwise than it requireth, there is a <hi>partial Apostasie</hi> from it, whose Guilt and Danger answers the Degrees and Measures which in each kind it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds unto.</p>
               <p>And this is that which we may charge, yea which the Lord Christ in his Word doth charge on every Nation under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:204232:64"/> where the Gospel is publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. Men are apt to please themselves, to approve of their own State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, wherein they have framed unto themselves Rest and Satisfaction. Churches content themselves with their outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Administrations, especially where accompanyed with Secular Advantages; and contend fiercely that all is well, and the Gospel sufficiently complyed withall, whilest their outward Constitution is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and their Laws of Order kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate; About these is the World filled with endless Digladiations, wherein the most aim at no more but success in their especial Contests. Only a few remain who fruitlessely complain, that under all these Conflicts, the Glory, Power, and Purity of Christian Religion is lost in the World. And it is known that the Judgement of Christ concerning Churches, as unto their good or bad spiritual Estate, is oft-times very distant from their own concerning themselves. It was not onely for their sakes, but as a Warning unto all others in all Ages, that it is entred on an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Record, that when the Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi> judged and declared without haesita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that she was <hi>rich, increased in Goods,</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:204232:64"/>
                  <hi>and wanted nothing,</hi> the Lord Christ, the <hi>Amen,</hi> the <hi>true and faithfull Witness,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth her <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>miserable.</hi> That things at this day are in no better a Condition in many, in most Churches in the World, is too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be denyed with any pretence of Reverence to the Word of God; and it will be afterwards made to appear.</p>
               <p>Certainly the Lord Christ may say to the Churches and Nations among whom his Name is yet owned in the World, what God said of old concerning that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> then his only Church; <hi>I had plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee a Noble Vine, wholly a right Seed; how then art thou turned into the degenerate Plant of a wild Vine unto me? Jer.</hi> 2. 21. Yea, to most of them as in another place; <hi>How is the faithfull City become an Harlot? it was full of Judgement, Righteousness lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, but now Murderers. Thy Silver is become dross, thy Wine mixed with Water; Isa.</hi> 1. 21, 22. The Greatness of the Evil complained of, the secret Mystery of its Accomplishment, the Unreasonableness Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Ingratitude of the Fact, the Strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Event, makes the complaint to be formed into a <hi>Scheme</hi> of Admiration. And indeed, if a man be able to consider
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:204232:65"/> the Nature of the Gospel, with the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits communicated thereby unto Mankind, he cannot but be astonished to find the generality of them to be so soon weary of it, and so ready on all Occasions to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish it; For as future Glory and blessed Immortality are attainable onely thereby, so all that true Freedom, Tranquillity, Peace and Blessedness whereof our Nature in this Life is capable, are by no other means communicable unto the Souls of men. In brief, whatever is of Advantage in any gracious Communication from God unto us, without which we are nothing but the very worst and most malignant Product of Sin and Misery, it is all confined unto the Gospel and the Contents thereof. Wherefore the carelesness of men in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of it, their Wickedness in its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishment as to its Principles and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, may well be expressed as God doth in the inferiour Instance of the Apostasie of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>Hath a Nation changed their Gods, which are yet no Gods? But my People hath changed their Glory for that which doth not profit. Be astonished O ye Heavens at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the Lord.</hi> Yet thus is it and no otherwise, as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:204232:65"/> we shall afterwards manifest, amongst the generality of them that are called Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the world.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> violently pleads an Exemption from this Charge, by virtue of especial Priviledge. Not an <hi>internal</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Efficacious Grace unto their Minds and Wills, to preserve it and all that belongs unto it alwayes in saving Faith and Obedience, wherein alone a Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Gospel consists; but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Priviledge of <hi>Indefectibility</hi> keeping them in the state the Gospel requireth, they know not how, but as it were, whether they will or no.</p>
               <p>But there is no Party or Society of men under Heaven (considering the Notoriety of matter of Fact to the contrary) that can with less violence unto common Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty make use of this Pretence. So when the <hi>Jews</hi> of old were charged by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, of <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the Law and the Obedience which it required, with Threats of Destruction for their sins, they warded themselves from a Conviction of Guilt and Fear of Punishment, by an unreasonable, yea outragious Confidence in Church Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, then not onely appropriated but confined unto them, crying out, <hi>The Temple</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:204232:66"/>
                  <hi>of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord are these;</hi> This they thought sufficient to repell the Charge of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to vindicate their Innocency, and secure their Peace. The Reply of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet unto them will equally serve in both cases; <hi>Behold, ye trust in lying words which cannot profit. Will ye steal, murder and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, and swear falsely, and burn Incense unto Baal, and walk after other Gods whom ye know not; And come and stand before me in this House, which is called by my Name, and say, We are delivered to doe all these Abominations? Jerem.</hi> 7. 8, 9, 10. A Plea of Innocency and hope of Impunity, under an evident Guilt of the highest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, and the vilest of Superstitions, do equally participate of Folly and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>It is fallen out with this Church of <hi>Rome</hi> somewhat in like manner as it did with him from whom she falsely pretends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive her wonderfull Priviledge of <hi>Indefecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> For when our Lord Christ foretold that all men should forsake him, he alone with the highest Confidence, and in a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner undertook the contrary for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But all the Prerogative which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto issued onely in this, that when
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:204232:66"/> all the other Disciples forsook their Master and fled, according to his Prediction, he <hi>alone</hi> forsook him and <hi>denyed</hi> him. And that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of Failing which this Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates unto it self as its singular and incommunicable Priviledge, hath possibly been a means of, but assuredly is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with, a peculiar Apostasie above all other Churches in the World. Nothing certainly can be more vain in it self, nor more pernicious unto the Souls of them who are under the Power of such an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, than this Pretence, when all Evidences in matter of Fact do openly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie to the contrary. The Principal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its Communion are at thid day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in fierce bloody and causeless Warrs, and these so managed, as to be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with a Confluence of all those Evils and flagitious Wickednesses which have a tendency to make Mankind sinfull and miserable. Is this that Love and Peace which according to the Rule of the Gospel ought to be among the Disciples of Christ, and without which it is impossible they should have any Evidences in themselves, or give any Testimony unto the World, that so they are? Doth this answer the Promises to be accomplished in the dayes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:204232:67"/> of the <hi>Messia, Isa.</hi> 2. 3, 4. or the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Precepts given by Jesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as to Unity, Love and Peace? But Warres they say are Lawfull, and so no Argument that those engaged in them are Revolters from the Rule of the Gospel: I say it may be so; but it is far safer to judge all Warre unlawfull, than to justifie all the Warres that rage in <hi>Christendome;</hi> or to suppose them consistent with the Rule or Doctrine of the Gospel. The truth is, many things must concurre to reconcile any of them unto that Obedience which we owe to the Prince of Peace; Nor is any of them of that Nature or Necessity, but that if the Gospel had its proper Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy on the Minds of all that are called Christians, and its due Authority over their Consciences, they would be all prevented. However, in a Church pretending to be no way fallen off, or Apostatized from the Evangelical Rule, it is justly expected that another <hi>Representation</hi> be made of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion taught by Jesus Christ, than that which appears in the Desolations that are wrought in the Earth, through the Lusts and Rage of the Members of it. The state of things amongst them seems not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute that Kingdome of Righteousness,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:204232:67"/> Love and Peace, which Christ came to set up in the World, and which indeed at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by reason of the general Apostasie of the Nations, is little elsewhere to be found but in the Souls of his sanctified ones. And those particular Churches are blessed in a peculiar manner, who endeavour in their Profession and Obedience, in any measure to rise up unto an Expression thereof.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Lives of the Generality of them who adhere unto the Communion of that Church, of the most who <hi>preside</hi> therein, are openly contradictory unto the Evangelical Rule of Obedience. It may for the most part be said concerning them with respect unto the whole, as one of them said of a part of the New Testament; <hi>Either this is not Gospel, or we are not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> In brief, if the Kingdom of Light, and Truth and Holiness, of separation in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Affections, and Conversation from the World, of Communion with God, and Loving Kindness among Men, of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost, may become, and is become a Kingdom of Darkness, Pride, Ignorance, Ambition, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, Blood, Superstition and Idolatry; then and not else doth it visibly remain
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:204232:68"/> among them, and they have nothing Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized from the Laws and Government of it.</p>
               <p>But they can easily discharge themselves of the Guilt of this Imputation. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that the things mentioned be in part acknowledged to be so, (as to what purpose is it to deny the Sun to shine at Noon-day?) yet the Peace, Love, and Unity, the Holiness and Righteousness that ought according to the Gospel to be and reside in the Church, are found amongst them on other Accounts. For the whole Body of the Church and all the Members of it, agree and are united in one Head, even the <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> which is the onely Evangelical Unity required of the Disciples of christ; and the Holiness of the Worship with that of the Saints that have been among them, as also of their present reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Devotionists, and the charity of many, testified by Magnificent Works of Piety and Bounty, do sufficiently answer that <hi>Sanctification,</hi> Holiness and Love, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto christ in Heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Obedience, which the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. But this is no other but an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the true Nature of that Apostasie of the latter times, which is foretold by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:204232:68"/> the Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>In the last dayes perillous times shall come; for men shall be lovers of their own selves, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, proud, boasters, blasphemers, disobedient unto Parents, unthankefull, unholy, without natural Affection, truce-breakers, false Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, incontinent, sierce, despisers of those that are good, traytors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures, more than lovers of God, having a form of Godliness but denying the power thereof.</hi> Under the Power of the most filthy and outragious Lusts, men frame to themselves an outward <hi>Shape</hi> Image and Representation of Holiness; They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate a Form of Religion, by a Substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other things in the room of the Life and Substance of it, which are lost. The Power of Christianity is openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, in their being acted by the Power of all those Lusts which are contrary unto it. For the Grace of God in the Gospel <hi>teacheth</hi> them by whom it is received, <hi>to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world.</hi> This men cannot more perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, than in being <hi>foolish and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, deceived, serving divers lusts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, living in malice and envy, hatefull and hating one another;</hi> such Persons bein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:204232:69"/> remote from being <hi>saved by the washing of Regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Whilest men live in this state and condition, wherein a compleat Denyal or Renunciation of the Power of Godliness or Religion doth consist, if to supply the absence thereof, they draw and take on themselves a <hi>Scheme, Form,</hi> and <hi>Appearance</hi> of it, by the Application of the Names, Offices, and Properties of Gospel Effects unto outward lifeless Duties or <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi> of them, the Apostasie foretold is compleatly accomplished. This is to let <hi>David</hi> goe, and to foyst an Image covered with <hi>Goats hair</hi> in his stead; or at best like <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> to make <hi>brazen Shields</hi> in the room of those of <hi>Gold</hi> taken away by <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shak.</hi> No otherwise doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> deal in this matter. The Power of Faith, Love, Peace, Holiness, Conformity unto Christ, Self-denyal, and all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of an Heavenly conversation being lost and denyed among the generality of its Members, and all the real Glory of Christianity thereby forfeited and despised; they have set up a <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of it, wherewith they content themselves, and attempt to deceive others. Instead of that Mystical spiritual Union with himself and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:204232:69"/> among themselves which Christ prayed for, and purchased for his Disciples, they have substituted the <hi>Morphosis</hi> or <hi>Mormo</hi> of an Agreement in professing Subjection to the <hi>Popé of Rome:</hi> For that heavenly <hi>Love</hi> of one another in him, and for his sake, which he renews the Souls of Believers unto by his Grace, we are presented in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, with outward Works of Charity and Bounty, measured and valued by the Advantage which redounds unto the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Actors in this <hi>Show. Peace</hi> the great Legacy of Christ unto his followers, with God in their own Minds, with the whole Creation not shut up under the Curse, that comprehensive Grace and Mercy wherein is comprized all the Blessedness which in this World we can be made partakers of, is preserved in the flourishing Prosperity and Temporal Successes of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> The internal effectual Operations of the Spirit of Grace, have the outward Dispensations of Ordinances shuffled in their place and stead. Regeneration is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; Growth in Grace is Episcopal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation; the Application by Faith of the Blood of Christ once offered in an holy Sacrifice for us, must give way unto the daily Sacrifice of the <hi>Masse</hi> offered for the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:204232:70"/> Sins of the Quick and the Dead; Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines and some outward bodily Severities must supply the place of the <hi>Mortification</hi> of Sin; the Power whereof is never more lost and denyed than it is under the highest external Pretences of it. So the whole Work of the Spirit, as a Spirit of Grace and Supplication in the Church, must be, and is unto themselves satisfactorily repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, by reading, saying, chanting with Voyces and Musical Instruments, Prayers and Praises invented and composed by they know not whom, and in a <hi>Language</hi> which the most of those who are obliged to comply with them, understand not at all.</p>
               <p>And even the worst part of their Image is in what they have fixed on as the Delineation and Representation of the Rule and Discipline of Christ in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. For rejecting that humble, holy, meek, diligent endeavour to preserve all the Faithfull in Obedience, Love, Unity, and fruitfull Walking, by the Application of the Commands of Christ unto their Souls and Consciences through his Spirit, and with his Authority; They have erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a worldly <hi>Domination over Gods Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> in whose Exercise more Force, Fraud,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:204232:70"/> Extortion, Oppression, Violence and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, have been acted and perpetrated, than it may be in the secular Government of any Tyrannical State in the World.</p>
               <p>Other Instances of the like Nature might be given. This is that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that <hi>figure</hi> and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of Evangelical Truth and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, wherewith these men would counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance themselves in, and cover from others, that Apostasie from the Gospel which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Lusts have cast them into, and keep them under the Power of, according as it was foretold it should come to pass in the <hi>latter dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is yet replyed, That whatever Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions others may have, or whatever Judgement shall be made of the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Evils reigning among the generality of them, and their seeming inconsistency with the Doctrine of the Gospel, yet the <hi>Promise of the Spirit to lead into all Truth,</hi> is not only granted but <hi>confined</hi> unto them; so as that they are eternally secured as to Faith and Belief, whatever other miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they may fall into. And the Nature of this Plea is so effectual, that if it could be made good and confirmed on their behalf, notwithstanding I see not as yet how it is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:204232:71"/> possible to solve other difficulties that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in this case, yet would it with me determine all things in <hi>controversie</hi> between them and us. Let them but evince that they <hi>alone</hi> do inherit the promised Spirit of Christ, exclusively unto all others, that he dwells, resides, works, guides in and among them <hi>alone;</hi> and in other things we will spare them the trouble of further pleading their Cause. But their pretence hereunto is impotent and contemptible. For what they insist upon amounts to no more but this; that They being the Church the Promise of giving the Spirit is made and fulfilled unto Them alone, which only beggs the Matter that is in principal dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between us; and the Disputes about it are endless. If indeed they argued on the other hand, that they are the onely Church of Christ, because they alone enjoy the Promise of the Spirit, as the Inference were undoubtedly certain, (for it is the presence of Christ by his Spirit that gives being or Existence unto the Church) so the Truth of the Assertion were capable of an easie Trial and a satisfactory Determination. For where the Spirit doth so reside, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Promise of Christ, and abide with any, as he doth with no other in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:204232:71"/> same kind, he will infallibly <hi>manifest</hi> his presence by his Operations, and sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidence them with whom he is, to be the Church of Christ, seeing as he is the promised Spirit of Truth the <hi>World</hi> cannot receive him. His Operations are all of them either in a way of <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Gifts;</hi> and his Gifts are either Extraordinary or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. When therefore those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can manifest that they enjoy such gracious Operations of the Spirit, as others enjoy nothing of the same Kind, or that they are furnished and supplyed with such <hi>spiritual Gifts</hi> either Ordinary or Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, as no other do participate of with them or besides them; not proving it by saying they alone are the Church and therefore it must be so, but by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the things themselves as it was in the Primitive Times, they shall not only free themselves from the Charge of any dangerous Apostasie from the Gospel, but enjoy moreover all that their hearts can wish.</p>
               <p>But this Pretence hath been so often and so fully evinced of Falshood, and that by all means of Conviction in the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Causes and Effects, (it being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyably demonstrated, That as no such
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:204232:72"/> Promise was ever peculiarly made unto them, much less on such terms of security as they imagine, and that in the issue as unto matter of Fact instead of being <hi>lead into all Truth,</hi> they have departed almost from all,) that it needs not again to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on. And indeed such a Promise as is pretended, is altogether inconsistent with the Glory and Honour of the Gospel of God. The Word of the Gospel, that is, the Truth contained therein is the sole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Instrument of the Reconciliation of Sinners unto God, and of their Walking before him in Obedience unto his Glory; other End and Use it hath none. To give by irrevocable Grant the Possession of this Truth and not in order unto that End, and so to continue it whether ever that Effect be produced or no, yea where it is not, corresponds not with other Fruits of the Wisdom of God in the Dispensation of his Grace. And whereas the Gospel as to the Nature of its Doctrine will and may be interpreted by its Fruits and Effects in the Lives of men; to allow them the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of its Truth on a supposition of a course of sin, and a continuance in a state of Irreconciliation or Enmity against God, is to expose the Doctrine of it, and the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204232:72"/> Law of Obedience contained in it, to just censure and reproach.</p>
               <p>Wherefore notwithstanding these or any other Pretences of an alike Nature, we may safely proceed to shew, How the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Christians have <hi>partially Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> from the Gospel, and to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wayes, Means, Causes, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons thereof.</p>

               <head type="sub">Apostasie from the Mystery, Truth or Doctrine of the Gospel. Proneness of Persons and Churches thereunto; proved by all sorts of Instances.</head>
               <p>THere are three things in the Gospel which are as the Essentially consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive parts of it: (1) The <hi>Mystery</hi> of its <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which is the <hi>Object</hi> of Faith. (2) The <hi>Holiness</hi> of its <hi>Precepts,</hi> which is the <hi>Matter</hi> of our Obedience. And (3) the <hi>Purity</hi> of its <hi>Institutions</hi> of Worship, which is the <hi>Trial</hi> of our Faith and Obedience, as to their Profession. With respect unto these we are to make our Enquiry, both as unto matter of Fact, and as unto the Reasons, Causes, and Occasions of it, in the Apostasie from them that is in the world. Instances hereof in every one of the particulars mentioned we shall find in our own dayes, and those both deplorable and of ill abode. But I shall not confine my self unto the present Age, nor unto
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:204232:73"/> what is done or come to pass among our selves; but consider things with respect unto the whole Course and Progress of Religion since the first Preaching and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Mystery</hi> of the Truth or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel which is the <hi>Object of our Faith,</hi> is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of its Precepts and Institutions, of the Holiness it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and of the Worship that it appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Where this is forsaken, the others cannot be retained. Men may <hi>profess</hi> the Truth, and yet not yield <hi>Obedience</hi> unto it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. But without the <hi>real Belief</hi> of it, no man can be <hi>obedient</hi> as he ought. The Obedience which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel requireth, is the <hi>Obedience of Faith, Rom.</hi> 1. 5. or being <hi>Obedient unto the Faith, Act.</hi> 6. 7. It is this Grace of God alone which <hi>teacheth men to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, to live soberly righteously and godly in this world,</hi> so as to find Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God therein, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Wherever therefore this is rejected, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, forsaken, declined from by any, so far as it is so, so far there is and will be an <hi>Apostasie</hi> from all other Concernments of the Gospel. This therefore we are to enquire into. And we shall find in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:204232:74"/> that all sorts of Persons, all Churches are and alwayes have been exceedingly prone to turn aside from the Mystery and Truth of the Doctrine of the Gospel; that they have done so accordingly, and that those which are now in the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be of the same Temper and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And as it will appear that no evil practices are indulged unto on this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; so it is desireable that those who are secure in this matter on such Principles as wherewith they are satisfied, would not with too much severity reflect on them who cannot but be jealous over themselves and others. The great Apostle himself makes this the principal Ornament in the preparation of his Triumph upon the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of his Ministry, That he <hi>had kept the Faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. <hi>I am</hi> (saith he) <hi>ready to be offered, and the time of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture is at hand, I have fought a good fight, I have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith, henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that day.</hi> Of all that made way for that Triumphant Glory which he now had a Prospect of, he insists on this onely in particular, that he had <hi>kept the Faith,</hi> which he did not doe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:204232:74"/> without a severe Warfare and Conflict. So great a matter was that in his Esteem, which most suppose so common, so easie, that little Diligence or Watchfulness is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired thereunto. And the frequent so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Charges with pathetical Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he gives unto his Son <hi>Timothy</hi> to be carefull herein, manifest both the weight he laid upon it, the difficulty that was in it, and the danger of miscarriage wherewith it was attended; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20, 21. <hi>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain Bablings, and Oppositions of Science falsely so called; which some professing, have erred concerning the Faith.</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 13, 14. <hi>Hold fast the Form of sound words which thou hast heard of me, in Faith and Love, which is in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was committed unto thee, keep, by the Holy Ghost which dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us.</hi> And the same Apostle expressely mentions the proneness of some to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish the Truth of the Gospel; whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would have rebuked sharply, that <hi>they migbt be sound in the Faith,</hi> not giving heed to Fables and Comandments of men turning away from the Truth; <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 13, 14. Neither would there be any need that some should earnestly <hi>contend for the Faith once</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:204232:75"/>
                  <hi>delivered unto the Saints, Jude</hi> 3. but that others are very ready to corrupt it, and turn away from it.</p>
               <p>Examples of this <hi>State</hi> and Event of things among all the Churches in the world, since the first Planting of them in and by the Doctrine of the Gospel, will give more Evidence unto the Truth of our Assertion, and a clear Account of that Matter of Fact whose Reasons and Causes we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into. And because I would confine my self unto the full Declaration of the Mystery of Christ, I shall not insist on the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But it is known unto all, how from their first Transgression in making the <hi>gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calf,</hi> whereon as God complains they <hi>quickly,</hi> in a few dayes, turned out of the way, they were continually prone unto all sorts of Apostasie; And in the Issue, the Generality of them fell off from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> by their Unbelief, as the Apostle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. And it is to be feared, that the Appearance and Pretence of some <hi>Christian</hi> Churches unto better success, have this onely Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that their Wayes and Practices are not recorded by the Spirit of God as theirs were. But I shall not insist on that Instance.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:204232:75"/>
               <p> Of all the Churches that are or ever were in the World, those gathered and planted by the Apostles themselves, had the greatest Advantage to know the <hi>Mystery</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of the Gospel, and the most forcible Reasons unto Constancy and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance therein. Considering the <hi>Ability</hi> of their Teachers to reveal unto them the <hi>whole Counsel of God,</hi> with their <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in <hi>with-holding nothing that was profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto them; Act.</hi> 20; their <hi>Authority,</hi> as being sent immediately by Jesus Christ, and their absolute <hi>Infallibility</hi> in all that they delivered; a man would rationally think that there were no room, no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence left for any to decline in the least from the Doctrine wherein they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by them; nor any Advantage for Sathan or Seducers to practise upon them. There is no doubt but most of us suppose, that had we been so taught by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves, nothing could ever tempt us to doubt or waver; much less to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish any Truth wherein we were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed. But alas! this thought is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Apprehension of the <hi>rich Man</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> who judged that if one rose <hi>from the Dead</hi> to warn his Brethren, they would Repent and be Converted unto God. But
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:204232:76"/> as <hi>Abraham</hi> told him, if they would not <hi>believe Moses and the Prophets, neither would they believe should one rise from the dead;</hi> no more would we, if we be not constant and steadfast in the Doctrine of the Gospel as revealed in the Scripture, be so if we had been taught it by all the Apostles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. An Example of this proneness to relinquish Evangelical Principles we have in most of the Churches called and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, whose Faith and Practice is recorded in their writings.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was planted by the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> and watered by <hi>Apollos</hi> that great <hi>Evangelist;</hi> And none can que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but that they were fully instructed by them in all the Principles of the Gospel; which is evident also from that Abundance of spiritual Gifts which above any other Church they had received. But yet within a few years, before the writing of his <hi>first Epistle</hi> unto them, which was not above five or six years at the most, many of them fell into that Fundamental Error of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Resurrection of the dead,</hi> whereby they wholly annihilated, (as the Apostle declares) the whole Death and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ; rendering what seemed to remain of their Faith altogether vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:204232:76"/>
               <p> The Churches of the <hi>Galatians</hi> are yet a more pregnant Instance. Converted they were unto the Faith of Christ, and planted in their Church State by the Ministry of the same Apostle. And although he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed them <hi>in the whole Counsel of God,</hi> yet it may be justly supposed that he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in nothing more than to establish them in the Knowledge and Faith of the Grace of God in Christ, and the free <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of Believers by Faith in him or his Blood alone. For this he every where declareth to have been his principal Aim and Design in the whole Course of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry. The Doctrine hereof they received with so much Joy and Satisfaction, that they valued the Apostle as <hi>an Angel of God,</hi> received him as <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and esteemed him above the Sight of their own eyes; <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 14, 15. But yet after all this, upon a sudden, so as that he was surprized with it and amazed at it, they fell from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Grace and Justification by Faith alone, to seek after Righteousness as it were by the Works of the Law, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>O foolish Galatians,</hi> saith he, <hi>who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched you, that you should not obey the Truth, before whose Eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you?</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:204232:77"/> Notwithstanding the evident Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Truth which they had received, and Experience of the Power of the Word, which he mentions <hi>vers.</hi> 2. yet all on a sudden they <hi>apostatized</hi> from it. And as the Foundation hereof lay in the uncured Folly and Vanity of their Minds, (as we shall see afterwards that it doth in all alike cases,) yet the strangeness of the Manner of it, that it should be so <hi>sudden,</hi> and it may be <hi>universal,</hi> makes him ask if there were not some <hi>strange fascination</hi> or spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Witchcraft</hi> in it. So have we seen Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons among our selves, who in a day or two have renounced all those Principles of Truth wherein they have been instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and embraced a <hi>Systeme</hi> of Notions <hi>diametrically</hi> opposite unto them; insomuch as some have supposed that there hath been a real <hi>diabolical</hi> Fascination in the Matter. Now this Apostasie of the <hi>Galatians</hi> was such, as the Apostle peremptorily declares that Christ and all the Benefits of his Death were renounced therein.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, although we may be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it and bewayl it, that sundry Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are so ready to fall off from the same Truth in the same Manner, yet ought we not to think strange of it, or be moved
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:204232:77"/> by it; seeing that whole Churches <hi>called</hi> and <hi>instructed</hi> therein, and that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by the Apostle himself, did so fall in a short time after their first Plantation.</p>
               <p>It is more than probable, that those who endeavoured to make <hi>a spoyl</hi> of the <hi>Colossians</hi> by <hi>Philosophy and vain deceit, after the Tradition of men, Chap.</hi> 2. 8. had no small success among them. And such things they were, wherewith they were attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beguiled, as took them off from <hi>holding the Head,</hi> turning them aside unto the curious Speculations of men <hi>vainly pufft up in their own fleshly minds,</hi> vers. 18, 19. Things of the like nature may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in most of the other Churches unto whom the <hi>Epistles</hi> are directed.</p>
               <p>And in those unto particular Persons, as unto <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> he warns them of this <hi>Readiness</hi> of all sorts of Persons to Apostatize from the Truth, giving express Instances in some by <hi>Name</hi> who had done so themselves, and sedulously endeavoured the overthrow of the Faith of others. The Holy Apostle <hi>John</hi> lived to see more of these wofull turnings aside from the Truth, and Relinquishments of Evangelical My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. Hence in his Epistle he gives an Account expressely of the Apostasies that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:204232:78"/> were among Professors of the Gospel, of the Seducers, and their Pretences where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was promoted, warning Believers of the danger thereof, and of sundry Duties incumbent on them necessary to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation: And the Epistle of <hi>Jude</hi> is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the same purpose. It is known also how most of the Churches unto whom the Lord Jesus Christ granted the favour of his <hi>Visitation,</hi> wherein he tried and judged their State and Condition, their Stability in, and Declensions from the Truth, were found guilty by him as to some Degrees of Backsliding and Apostasie, for which they were severely reproved.</p>
               <p>Certainly we can never enough admire the profound Negligence and Security of most Churches and Professors in the world, with respect unto a due Adherence unto the Mysteries and Truths of the Gospel. Some think that they have such a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as that they can never decline from them, or mistake about them, nor have done so in the long Tract of Sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, although they have been plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into all Manner of wickedness and carnal Security. Others are wanton and careless under their Profession, making <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>le difference between Truth and Error,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:204232:78"/> or however suppose that it is no great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement to abide in the Truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have been instructed. And these things have brought most Churches and Places under the Power of that Apostasie which shall afterwards be discovered. But if the Churches thus planted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves were liable unto such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and many of them did actually, at least for a season, fall away from most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Doctrines of the Gospel (from whence it may be they had never been recovered, if healing had not been timely applyed by <hi>Apostolical</hi> Authority and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,) can we who have not their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, nor some of the Evidences of the Truth which they enjoyed, having all the same Causes of Apostasie <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> which they had to be tryed withall, expect that we shall be perserved, unless we watchfully and carefully attend unto all the Wayes and Means whereby we may so be. But these things will be spoken unto afterwards.</p>
               <p>We may in the next place enquire, What was the State of the Churches after the ending and finishing of the <hi>Sacred Records,</hi> and the death of the Apostles, with all other Persons Divinely inspired? Here
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:204232:79"/> some would have us believe that all things were well, at least for a long season, and some that they are so to this very day. All that was believed and practised among them, must be esteemed almost as Sacred as the Gospel it self, and be made a part of the Rule of our Faith and Worship. It seems those very Churches which during the dayes of the Apostles and whilest they were under their Inspection, were so prone to mistakes, to follow their own Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or comply with the Inventions of others, yea in sundry Instances so as to Apostatize from the most important Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Gospel, were all on a sudden, on no other Advantage but being deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Apostolical</hi> Care and Oversight, so changed, established, and confirmed, that they declined not in any thing from the Truth and Rule of the Gospel. For my part I pay as great a Respect and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the Primitive Churches of the First, Second, and Third <hi>Centuries,</hi> as I think any man living can justly doe; But that they did in nothing decline from the Grace, Mystery, Truth, or Rule of the Gospel, that they gave no admittance unto vain Deceits after the Tradition of Men, and the Rudiments of the World, there
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:204232:79"/> are such Evidences unto the contrary, as none can believe it, but those who have a great Mind it should be so, and their Credulity at their disposal. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore briefly enquire what was foretold that would ensue among those Churches, and what came to pass accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Elders of the Church of Ephesus</hi> that <hi>he knew that after his departure grievous Wolves would enter among them, not sparing the flock; Act.</hi> 20. 29. Though he compare them to <hi>devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wolves,</hi> yet are they not bloody Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors by external Force that he doth intend. For that Expression, <hi>shall enter in among you,</hi> denotes an Admission into the Society and Converse of the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of the same Profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. They are therefore <hi>Hereticks</hi> and Seducers who lay in wait to Deceive through various Sleights and cunning Craftiness, being not (whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) really of the Church, not of the flock of Sheep, no not in Profession, but devouring <hi>Wolves.</hi> The same Persons are intended who by <hi>Peter</hi> are called <hi>false Teachers,</hi> such as should <hi>privily bring in damnable heresies, denying the Lord that bought them,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. But the Apostle
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:204232:80"/> addes moreover in the next place; <hi>Also of your own selves shall men arise speaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse things, to draw away Disciples after them,</hi> vers. 30. I do not think that the Apostle in that Expression, <hi>Also of your own selves,</hi> intended precisely any of those who were then personally present with him, or at least it is not necessary that we should so judge; But some that were quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to succeed in their room and Office, are intended. And all the <hi>perverse things</hi> which they would teach, being contradictory to the Doctrine of the Gospel, contained some degrees of Apostasie in them. That they prevailed in this Attempt, that the Church was leavened and infected by them, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence, that not long after that <hi>Church</hi> is charged by our Saviour to be fallen in sundry things from its first Purity, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4, 5. So he assures <hi>Timothy,</hi> that the time would come, (and that speedily, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Prescription he makes for its prevention,) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>That men would not endure sound Doctrine, but after their own lusts should heap up to themselves Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, having itching ears, whereby they should be turned from the Truth, and turned unto Fables;</hi> vers. 3, 4. A plain Prediction of that Defection from Evangelical Truth and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:204232:80"/> Purity which was to befall the Churches, and did so. And this with the danger of it he doth more vehemently urge, as from a Spirit of Prophesie; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>Now the Spirit speaketh expressely, that in the latter times some shall depart from the Faith, giving heed to seducing Spirits and Doctrines of Devils.</hi> By that Phrase of speech, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit speaketh expressely,</hi> the Apostle under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands not a plain distinct Revelation made thereof unto himself alone, but that the infallible Spirit of God whereby himself and the rest of the Apostles were guided, did <hi>every where</hi> testifie the same. It is an Expression not unlike that he useth, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 24. <hi>The Holy Ghost witnesseth in every City;</hi> that is, in all places those who were Divinely inspired agreed on the same Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>And I judge the Apostles did every where by joynt consent acquaint the Churches, that after the Gospel had been received and professed for a while, there would ensue a <hi>notable Apostasie</hi> from the Truth and Worship of it. So <hi>Jude</hi> tells them, <hi>vers.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>That the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ told them, that in the latter dayes there should be Mockers, who walk after their hearts lusts.</hi> This All the Apostles
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:204232:81"/> agreed in the Prediction of, and warned all the Churches concerning it. S. <hi>John</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> chap. 4. 3. <hi>This is that Spirit of Antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come.</hi> He speaks of the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Antichrist, and therewithall an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie from the Faith, as that which they had been fully instructed in. And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth it as that which not onely they were forewarned of, but also acquainted with some particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, which it was not, it may be, convenient in those dayes to mention pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly for fear of Offence; <hi>There must</hi> (saith he) <hi>be a falling away,</hi> or an Apostasie from the Faith, under the leading of the Man of Sin; <hi>And,</hi> saith he, <hi>remember ye not that when I was yet with you, I told you these things, and now ye know what withholdeth,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3, 5, 6. He had both told them of the Apostasie, and also acquainted them with <hi>one particular</hi> about it, which he will not now mention. This being the great Testimony of the Spirit of God in those dayes, that the <hi>Visible Church</hi> should so fall away from the Faith; one of the cheif Wayes whereby Sathan brought it to pass, was by the advancing of a contrary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Principle, namely, That this or
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:204232:81"/> that Church, the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, was Infallible and Indefectible, and could never <hi>fall away</hi> from the Faith. By this Means he obliterated out of the Minds of Men the former Warnings given by the Spirit unto the Churches, so rendring them secure, defeating the Ends of the Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For hereby he not onely lead men insensibly into the greatest Apostasie, but taught them to adhere invincibly unto what they had done, and with the highest Confidence to justifie themselves therein. But all those and many other Warnings did the Holy Ghost give concerning the <hi>Defection</hi> from the Mystery of the Gospel, which the Churches would in succeeding times fall into, which being neglected by secure Professors whilest their Faith was weakened and undermined by innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Artifices, issued in their Apostasie. For these things being thus expressely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Spirit of God himself, we may briefly enquire into the Event of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions mentioned, and whether indeed they came to pass or no?</p>
               <p>An Account in general of the state of the Church after the dayes of the Apostles we have given us by <hi>Hegesippus,</hi> who lived
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:204232:82"/> in the next Age after them, as his words are recorded by <hi>Eusebius, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. Relating the Martyrdom of <hi>Simon</hi> the Son of <hi>Cleopas,</hi> he addes; <hi>Ʋnto these times the Church continued a pure and incorrupted Virgin; those who endeavoured to corrupt the Rule of saving Truth, where any such were, lying hid in obscurity. But after that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Company of the Apostles came to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ends, and that Generation was past who heard the Divine Wisdome with their own ears, a Conspiracy of wicked Error by the Seductions of those that taught strange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines began to take place; and where none of the Apostles were remaining, they began to set up their Science falsely so called with open face, against the Preaching of the Truth.</hi> We have already seen that there were many Declensions in the dayes of the Apostles themselves; But as they were jealous over all the Churches with Godly Jealousie, (for having <hi>espoused them to one Husband,</hi> they took care to present them as <hi>a chaste Virgin</hi> unto Christ, (the words which <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesippus</hi> alludes unto) and thereon watched against all Wayes and Means whereby as <hi>the Serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, least their Minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ,</hi> by the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:204232:82"/> of other Doctrines than what they had received from them, as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2, 3, 4.) so by their Wisdom, Diligence and Watchfulness, they were for the most part soon reduced from their Wandrings, and recovered from their Mistakes. Hence this holy Man pronounceth the Church a <hi>pure Virgin</hi> during the dayes of the Apostles and their Inspection, at least comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to what ensued thereon. For imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after he acknowledgeth that they were much corrupted and defiled, that is, fallen off from <hi>the simplicity that is in Christ,</hi> intending probably those very things wherein after-Ages made them their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. For things quickly came unto that state in the world, and which yet with the most continueth therein, that men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire no greater Warranty for their Practice in Religion, than the shaddow or Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any thing that was in use or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among those Churches, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therein went off evidently from the Simplicity that is in Christ.</p>
               <p>This Account and unquestionable Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony we have in general of the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the Predictions before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned concerning a Declension that was to ensue from the Power, Purity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:204232:83"/> of the Gospel. But whatever is here intended, it must be looked on as the very Beginning and Entrance of the Apostasie that ensued, which can scarce be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in comparison of that Excess which it quickly proceeded unto. In particular, the parts of the Sacred Predictions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, may be reduced unto four heads. (1.) <hi>Men from among themselves speaking perverse things.</hi> (2.) <hi>Grievous Wolves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in, not sparing the Flock.</hi> (3.) Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness, and not <hi>enduring of sound Doctrine,</hi> but turning the mind unto Fables, and from the Truth. (4.) A Gradual secret mysterious Work of a <hi>general Apostasie</hi> in the whole visible Church. And it might be easily demonstrated by Instances, how all these had their particular Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, untill the whole Apostasie foretold was formed and compleated. We may give some short remarks upon them all.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) It cannot be denyed, but that many of the principal Teachers in the first Ages of the Church after the Apostles, especially among those whose Writings remain unto Posterity, did in a Neglect of the Gospel and its Simplicity, embrace and teach sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things <hi>perverse,</hi> curious, and contrary
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:204232:83"/> to the form of wholsome words committed unto them; whilest for any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, they were not so duely conversant in Evangelical Mysteries with Reverence and godly Fear, as it was their Duty to have been. It is known how instances hereof might be multiplyed out of the Writings of <hi>Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clemens, Origen, Tatianus, Athenagoras, Tertullian, Lactantius</hi> and others. But I shall not reflect with any Severity on their Names and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories who continued to adhere unto the Fundamental Principles of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though what by curious Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what by <hi>Philosophical</hi> Prejudices and Notions, by wrested <hi>Allegorical Expositions</hi> of Scripture, by Opinions openly false and contradictory to the Word of God, they much corrupted and debased the pure and holy Doctrine of Jesus and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The <hi>grievous Wolves</hi> foretold of, who were to <hi>spoyl the Flock,</hi> I look on as <hi>Hereticks</hi> in their various Kinds. And on this Account it would seem to exceed all Belief, what multitudes and Sholes of all sorts of Persons fell off from the Mystery and Truth of the Gospel, after they had been declared unto them and professed by
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:204232:84"/> them; which is a full Confirmation of the Assertion before laid down. But they may in general be reduced unto two heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of those who in a Regardlesness and Contempt of the Gospel which they had received and professed, fell away into foolish extravagant heathenish Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unintelligible endless fancies, for the most part (as is supposed) accompanyed with wicked Practices, whereby although they would retain the Name of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they compleatly and absolutely fell off from Christ and his Gospel. Such were the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> in all their Branches, and under their several Appellations, <hi>Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Manichees,</hi> and others almost innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, with whose Names, Rise, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Course of Lives, <hi>Epiphanius, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> and <hi>Phylastrius</hi> have filled up their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues. It may be said they were all of them Persons of so great Abominations that they deserve no consideration among such as own Christian Religion. But the greater the Abominations were which they fell into, the more wilde, senceless and wicked were their Imaginations, considering the multitudes of professed Christians which fell into them, the more effectual is the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:204232:84"/>
                  <hi>Testimony</hi> they give unto the Truth of our Assertion. For were there not an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible proneness in the Minds of men, to relinquish the Mystery of the Gospel, was it not promoted by unutterable Folly and secret Enmity against the Truth, would it have been possible that so early in the Church, taking date immediately from the decease of the Apostles, such multitudes of professed Christians, should openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce those sacred Truths, for such noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous foolish Imaginations? These are they who are expressely prophesied of, that they should <hi>bring in damnable heresies, denying the Lord that bought them, bringing on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves swift destruction; many following their pernicious wayes, by reason of whom the way of Truth was evil spoken of;</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2. For all their impious Opinions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were by the Heathen objected unto, and charged on <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> as is evident in <hi>Origens</hi> Reply to <hi>Celsus,</hi> among others; and so by reason of them <hi>the way of Truth</hi> was <hi>evil spoken of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There was another sort of <hi>Heresies</hi> and so of real Apostasie from the Mystery of the Gospel, whose Authors and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers yet pretended an Adherence unto and Profession thereof. And these may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:204232:85"/> to two heads: (1) Concerning the <hi>Person,</hi> and (2) concerning the <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ. Of the first sort the principal and most prevalent was that of the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> in denying his <hi>Deity;</hi> the latter that of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> in opposing his <hi>Satisfaction, Merit,</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi> The first of these was poured out as a Flood from the mouth of the Old Serpent, and bare all before it like a Torrent; the latter insinuated it self as Poyson into the very Vitals of the Church. The first as a <hi>burning Fever</hi> carryed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Death with it and before it; the latter as a <hi>Gangrene</hi> or <hi>Hectical distemper</hi> insensibly consumed the vital Spirits of Religion. In the first we have a most wofull Evidence of the <hi>Instability</hi> of Professors, and their Readiness to forgoe the saving Mysteries of the Gospel. For in little more than half an Age after its first Rise, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Christians in the world, <hi>Bishops, Priests</hi> and <hi>People</hi> fell under the Power of it, and in their publick Confessions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and denyed the true eternal Deity of the Son of God. For having obtained the Patronage of some Emperours, as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> and <hi>Valence,</hi> and the suffrage of innumerable Prelates, who joyntly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted this <hi>Heresie</hi> by Force and Fraud;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:204232:85"/> almost the whole world as to outward Profession was for a season lead into this Apostasie, wherein some whole Nations, (as the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,)</hi> continued for sundry Ages afterward. And for the latter, or <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> it secretly, subtilly and gradually so insinuated it self into the Minds of men, that for the Substance of it, it continues to be no small part of that Religion which the generality of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doe at this day profess, and is yet upon a prevalent progress in the World. This is the Second way of the Apostasie of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors which was foretold by the Holy Ghost, which so came to pass as that the wounds which Christianity received there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are not healed unto this day.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Another way was, that men should grow <hi>weary of sound Doctrine,</hi> and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able, for the Reasons afterwards to be insisted on, to endure it any longer, should hearken after <hi>Fables,</hi> and be turned away from the Truth. And this no less eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to pass than any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. About the third Century it was that <hi>Monkish Fables</hi> began to be broached in the world. And this sort of men, instead of the Doctrines of the Grace of God, of Justification by the Blood of Christ, of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:204232:86"/> Faith and Repentance, of New Obedience and walking before God according to the Commands of Christ and Rule of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, which men grew weary of and could not well longer endure, filled their Minds, and satisfied their <hi>itching Ears,</hi> with stories of Dreams and Visions, of Angelical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in themselves, of self-invented De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, of uncommanded Mortifications, and a thousand other foolish Superstitions. By such <hi>Fables</hi> were innumerable Souls turned from the Truth and Simplicity of the Gospel, thinking that in these things alone Religion consisted, despising the whole Doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostles in comparison of them. These are particularly prophesied of and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. By the Hypocrisie, and Lyes, fabulous Stories and Doctrines of Devils of this sort of men, the Body of the Christian people was so leavened and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Belief of vain Delusions, and the Practice of foolish Superstitions, that little or nothing was left sound or wholsome among them.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Lastly, the secret working of the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> in, under, and by all these wayes and other Artifices innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which the subtilty of Sathan, with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:204232:86"/> the Vanity of the Minds and Lusts of the Hearts of Men made use of, wrought out that fatal Apostasie which the World groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under and was ruined by, when it came unto its height in the Papacy. The Rise and Progress of this Catholick Defection, the Wayes, Means and Degrees of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, its successefull Advance in several Ages, have been so discovered and laid open by many, so far as the Nature of so mysterious a Work is capable of a Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in this World, that I shall not need to repeat here any Instance of it. In brief, the Doctrine of the Gospel was so depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the Worship of it so far corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Waters of the Sanctuary seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like the River <hi>Jordan</hi> to run and issue in a Dead Sea, or like those of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to be turned into Blood, that would yield no Refreshment unto the Souls of Men. So was that Prophetical Parable of our Saviour fulfilled; <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 12, 13, 14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I proceed to particulars among our selves in this kind, I shall yet further confirm our Assertion in general, by the Consideration of the Second Venture (if I may so say,) that God gave the Gospel in the World, the Second Trial which he
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:204232:87"/> hath made of many Churches and Nations, and what hath been the Event and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess thereof.</p>
               <p>During the season spoken of, the Church was <hi>driven into the Wilderness,</hi> as to its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Profession, where it was secretly nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by the Spirit and Word of God, and the few Witnesses unto the Truth which yet remained, prophesied in Sackcloth, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sealing their Testimony (whereby the World was disquieted and tormented) with their Blood. But when the time came that God would again graciously visit the remnant of his Inheritance, he stirred up, gifted, and enabled many faithful Servants of Christ, by whom the work of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was successefully begun and carried on in many Nations and Churches. It is true, they arrived not therein at the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Peace of the Apostolical Churches, nor was it by some of them absolutely aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at. And this quickly manifested it self by the great differences that were among them both in Doctrine and Worship, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those mutual Contests and Divisions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, which proved the principal Means of obstructing the Progress of their whole Work, and continueth to do so to this very day. But a state of a blessed and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:204232:87"/> usefull Recovery it was from that Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie into Errors, Heresies, Superstitions and Idolatries, which the whole professing Church of these parts of the World was fallen into. And many wayes did it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest it self so to be.</p>
               <p>For, (1) The <hi>Doctrine</hi> taught by them generally, was <hi>agreeable to the Scripture,</hi> which they strenuously vindicated from the Corruptions of the foregoing Apostasie, and the Worship of the Churches was freed from open Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The <hi>Consciences</hi> of men pressed har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rased and distorted with innumerable vain Affrightments, Superstitions, foolish Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and false Opinions, whereby they were <hi>brought into bondage</hi> to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Guides of all sorts, and forced unto Services under the Name of <hi>Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> merely subservient unto their carnal Interests, were <hi>set at liberty</hi> by the Truth, and directed into the wayes of Gospel Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Multitudes had it <hi>given unto them</hi> on the behalf of Christ, not onely to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> in him but also to <hi>suffer</hi> for him, so that no less numbers sealed their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with their Blood, under the Power of those who undertook the Patronage of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:204232:88"/> present Apostasie, than did under the Rage of the Heathens at the first introduction of Christian Religion into the world.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) The <hi>Fruit</hi> which it hath brought forth in many Nations by the <hi>real Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of multitudes to God, their Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and holy Obedience, their solid spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Consolation in Life and Death, with many other things, do give Testimony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Work that it was of God.</p>
               <p>It cannot therefore be denyed, but that many Churches were by the Reformation brought into a state of <hi>Revalescency</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from that mortal Disease they had been under the Power of. But all men know what Care and Diligence is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to attain perfect Health and Soundness in such a Condition, and to prevent a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse, which if it should fall out, the last Error would be worse than the first. It might therefore have been justly expected from them, and it was their Duty to have gone on in the work of Reformation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they had come to a perfect Recovery of spiritual Health. But instead thereof things are so fallen out, by whose default God knows, that not onely the work hath received little or no Improvement among themselves in the Encrease of Light, Truth
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:204232:88"/> and Holiness, nor been progressive or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull in the world towards others, but also hath visibly and apparently lost its force, and gone backwards on all Accounts. Wherefore we have here also another sad Evidence of the proneness of men to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the Truths of the Gospel, after they have been instructed in them. I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance onely in the known Doctrines of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> aiming especially at what is of late years fallen out among our selves, in a sort of men whom the preceding Generations were unacquainted withall, which I shall therefore insist on apart and by it self afterwards.</p>
               <p>It is not unknown how ready many, yea multitudes are in all places to desert the whole Protestant Faith and Religion, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves into the baffled prostituted Remainders of the old Apostasie. Every slight Occasion, every Temptation of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Profit, Favour, Preferment, turns men unto the <hi>Papacy;</hi> and some run the same course merely to comply with the Vanity of their Minds in Curiosity, Novelty, and Conformity unto what is in fashion among men. Some fly unto it as a Sanctuary from Guilt, as that which tendereth more ready wayes for the Pacification of Conscience
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:204232:89"/> than that Faith and Repentance which the Gospel doth require. Some having lost the sence of all Religion in the pursuit of their Lusts, finding themselves uneasie in their Atheisme, or disadvantaged by the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, take shelter in the <hi>Roman</hi> Dress. Some are really entangled and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the power and subtilty of nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Seducers, who lye in wait to deceive. By one way and Means or another, on Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives known to themselves and him who useth them as his Engines to subvert the Faith, many in all places fall off daily to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and the old Superstition seems to be upon a new Advance, ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive another Edition in the world. Yea, it is to be feared, that there is in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces such a general Inclination unto a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or such an Indifferency to all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that multitudes want nothing but a Captain to conduct them back into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> For whereas they have lost all sence of the Power, Use, and Excellency of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Profession of Truth wherein they have been educated and instructed, and that by giving up themselves unto their Lusts and Pleasures, which will not fail to produce that cursed Effect, they either em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> to supply the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:204232:89"/> place of that, no Religion which they had left unto themselves; or if they pretend to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r to such a Pitch of Reason as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the vanity and folly of that Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on▪ and its inconsistency with all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of free generous and rational Minds, they betake themselves for a while unto a kind of <hi>Sceptical Atheisme,</hi> which having given them a sorry talkative Entertainment for a little space, by debasing and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Minds, gives them up again unto what they did before despise. By such Means are the Numbers of Apostates multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed amongst us every day.</p>
               <p>But there are yet other Instances of the proneness of Men in forgoing the Faith that the <hi>Church</hi> was retrived unto at the first Reformation. How great an Inroad hath been made on our first profession, at least an Alteration made therein, (whether for <hi>better</hi> or for <hi>worse</hi> the great Day will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,) by that <hi>Systeme</hi> of Doctrines which from its Author, and for distinctions sake is called <hi>Arminianisme!</hi> I am not bound to believe what <hi>Polinburgh</hi> affirms in his Preface to the Second Part of <hi>Episcopius</hi> his works; namely, That the most of the Prelates and Learned men in <hi>England</hi> are of their way and Judgement, which as
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:204232:90"/> stated by <hi>Episcopius</hi> hath many <hi>Racovian</hi> Additions made unto what it was at first. Nay, I do believe that what he asserts is false and calumnious unto the Persons he intends. But yet I wish withall that too much countenance were not given by many unto his Insinuation.</p>
               <p>A late Writer in <hi>a Treatise</hi> which he calls <hi>A sober and compassionate Enquiry,</hi> &amp;c. among other things of the like nature, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth that some dislike the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> on the Account of its Doctrine. And this they doe as he farther supposeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth <hi>not so punctually agree with the Synod of</hi> Dort <hi>as they could wish.</hi> To evidence the unreasonableness hereof, he informs us, That <hi>no one Father or Writer of the Church, whether Greek or Latine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St.</hi> Austins <hi>time agreed in Doctrine with the Determinations of that Synod. And as for St.</hi> Austin <hi>he was a devout Good man, but whose Piety was far more commendable than his Reason. And therefore rejects it with Indignation</hi> (as well he may) <hi>that a Novel</hi> Dutch <hi>Synod should prescribe Doctrine to the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and outweigh all Antiquity;</hi> and so closeth his Discourse with some unworthy Calumnies cast on the Divines of that Assembly, which were
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:204232:90"/> esteemed of the best that all the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> (that of <hi>France</hi> alone excepted) could afford at that time.</p>
               <p>But the Interest of the present Design which he had in hand, was more regarded in these Assertions than that of the Truth. It is but a pretence, that those whom he reflects upon do dislike <hi>the Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For look upon it as it is contained in the <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> in the <hi>Books of Homelies,</hi> and declared in the Authenticated Writings of all the Learned Prelates and others for <hi>Sixty years</hi> after the Reformation, wherein the Doctrine taught, approved and confirmed in this Church, was testified unto all the world; and the generality of those reflected on by him, do sacredly adhere unto it. It is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from this Doctrine that is by some complained of, and not the Doctrine it self. And how the Doctrine of the Person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, or of <hi>Curcelleus,</hi> of whose works <hi>Limburgh</hi> in his Preface unto them boasts, that they were so earnestly desired in <hi>England,</hi> can be brought into a consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with that of this Church so confirmed and declared, will require a singular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the Reconciliation of open multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed contradictions, and those in the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:204232:91"/> most weighty points of Religion, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Let but the Doctrine established at the first Reformation, as explained and declared in the Writings of the principal Persons who presided, lived and died in the Communion of this Church, which are the Measure of it in the judgement of all other Churches in the World, be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and adhered unto, and there will be neither difference nor complaint in this Matter. For the Disputes which have been, and which it may be alwayes will be among Learned men, concerning some Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse and Philosophical Notions about the Order of the divine Decrees, Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Nature of Humane Liberty, and the like innumerable, neither ever did or ever will much disturb the Peace of the Church. For as they are understood by very few, if by any at at all, so the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Christians are altogether uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with them, either as to their Faith or Obedience. Differences about them will be ended at the last day, and it may be as to the great End of the Gospel, that is time enough.</p>
               <p>But the pretence of this Author, that <hi>no one Father or Writer of the Church, Greek or Latine, before St.</hi> Austins <hi>time agreed</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:204232:91"/>
                  <hi>with the Determination of the Synod of</hi> Dort, is of little importance in this Cause. For as I suppose he may not speak this absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his own Trial and Experience, but rather on the suggestions of others, so it is no more than what is strongly pretended concerning the <hi>Doctrine of the Holy Trinity it self</hi> with respect unto the Determination and Declaration made of it at the Councel of <hi>Nice.</hi> And it were to be wished that too much countenance had not been given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Imagination, by <hi>Petavius</hi> and some others, whose Collections of ambiguous Expressions out of the ancient Writers of the Church, and Observations upon them, are highly boasted in by our present <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians.</hi> And as it may be it will not be easie for this Author positively to declare what was the judgement of <hi>any one anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writer</hi> in all points of Christian Belief, especially in such as had not received an especial Discussion from Oppositions made unto them in their own dayes, or before them; so it is confessed by all, that an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance is to be given unto general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of such Writers as seem occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to declare their present thoughts in any particular Doctrines, about which there had never been any Controversie in the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:204232:92"/> Church. For the proper signification of words themselves, whereby men express their Minds, is never exactly stated, untill the things themselves which they would signifie, have been thoroughly discussed. Hence the same words have had various Uses and diverse Significations in several Ages. And by this Rule, whatever be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that none of the Ancients before <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> were of the same Mind with those who assembled at <hi>Dort,</hi> it may with more Truth be affirmed, that none of them were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded but <hi>Origen</hi> onely, and those who were influenced by him, he being by many, on evident grounds, accused to have prepared the way and opened the door both unto <hi>Arianisme</hi> and <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Censure passed on <hi>Austin,</hi> namely, That <hi>his Piety was far more commendable than his Reason,</hi> is at least as <hi>novel</hi> as the <hi>Dutch Synod.</hi> For it is not the Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Piety, but the Disparagement of his Reason that is intended. And I must take the liberty to say, that either this Author hath not been much conversant in the Writings of this great and holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or he is a very incompetent Judge of the <hi>rational Abilities</hi> of them in whose
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:204232:92"/> Writings he is conversant. This Confidence in pronouncing a Censure so contrary to the concurrent sence of the generality of Learned men of all sorts in the Church for Twelve hundred years, savours too much of Partiality and Prejudice. But it is some relief, that the Adversaries of the Truth with whom he had to doe, were never able to discover nor make advantage of the weakness of his Reason. It was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the work whereunto God design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, which was not only to check and suppress the many Instances wherein sundry crafty Persons apostatized from the Truths of the Gospel, both in his own dayes and before; but also to give over the Light of Truth clearly discovered and strenuously vindicated, unto Posterity, for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Church in all Ages. Persons may freely despise the men of their present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests, against whom they have all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which may prompt them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and they have so much countenance in casting contemptuous Reflections on the principal first Reformers, as not to think therein they invade the bounds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Modesty. But what will be the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for their Confidence in such censures of the Rational Abilities of <hi>Austin,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:204232:93"/> conjecture, though the Reason of it I can easily guess at. However it needeth not be much taken notice of, seeing a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure somewhat more severe hath not long since been passed on St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself by a Writer of the same strain and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>There is little Ground of Fear as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that <hi>a novel Dutch Synod,</hi> (as it is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) though consisting of Persons delegated from all the principal Reformed Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> (that of <hi>France</hi> onely excepted) <hi>should prescribe Doctrines to the Church of England;</hi> seeing in that Synod the Church of <hi>England</hi> did rather prescribe Doctrines to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> than receive any from them. For the Divines which had the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Suffrage and Authority in that Assembly, were those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> sent thither by publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to testifie the Doctrine of this Church, and to lead the <hi>Dutch</hi> into the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession with themselves.</p>
               <p>But to return, it is to be feared that lest as <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> in its first Edition did secretly and gradually insinuate it self into the Animal and vital Spirits of the Body of the Church in those dayes, proving a Poyson unto it; so that under its new Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:204232:93"/> and gilding it will be received, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it diffuse it self into the Veins and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of the present Reformed Church-state in the World. This I know, that some pretending a Zeal for Holiness and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Life, do yet with a shamefull Partiality charge those Doctrines as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal means of the <hi>Decay of Piety,</hi> which they cannot but know were generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and avowed then when <hi>Piety</hi> most flourished in this Nation. But this is part of that Entertainment which the <hi>Church of England</hi> meets with at this day from her degenerate Offspring. The Doctrine of all the ancient Bishops must be traduced as the <hi>Means</hi> of the <hi>Decay of Piety.</hi> And which encreaseth the wonder, it had not this Effect till it began to be publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted and renounced. For whether they are the one the Cause of the other or no, yet there is a demonstrative Coincidence between the Originals of our visible Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie from <hi>Piety,</hi> and the Admission of these <hi>novel Opinions</hi> contrary to the Faith of the first Reformed Churches, and that they both bear the same date among us.</p>
               <p>But there is yet a greater Abomination effectually taking place among us, to the utter Overthrow of the Faith of some,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:204232:94"/> and the corrupting of the Minds of others from the Truth of the Gospel. This is the <hi>Leprosie</hi> of <hi>Socinianisme,</hi> which secretly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Walls and Timber of the House, whence it will not be scraped out. It commenced in the world some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other spring of a <hi>partial</hi> Apostasie before mentioned. But for a good space it lay fermenting in some obscure places of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Countreys adjacent. When the Books and Writings of the Authors and Promoters of the Opinions called by that Name came once to be known and read in other places, they were continually all of them abundantly answered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by Learned men of all sorts, so as it was justly hoped it would obtain no great success or progress in the world. But</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Latius excisae serpit contagio gentis</l>
                  <l>Victores{que} suos natio victa premit.</l>
               </q>
               <p>The Vanity of the Minds of Men, their weariness of sound Doctrine which they will endure no longer whatever they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, have given it admission either in part or in whole, among multitudes who once professed the Faith of the Gospel. For whereas the whole <hi>Systeme</hi> of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:204232:94"/> of those men is but a Collection of such Errors as formerly perplexed the Church, and overthrew the Faith of many, the principal and most material of them may be referred unto two heads: (1) <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinianisme,</hi> and (2) <hi>Pelagianisme.</hi> Unto the first are referred their denyal of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and consequently of the Divine <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of God. Under the latter, their Opposition unto the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ, the true Nature of his <hi>Priesthood</hi> and Sacrifice, <hi>Justification</hi> by Faith in his Blood, and the <hi>Imputation</hi> of his Righteousness, of the Efficacy of his <hi>Grace,</hi> and the Corruption of our <hi>Natures</hi> by the Fall, may be comprized. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the same Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the <hi>Eternity</hi> of the Punishment of the Damned in Hell, with other of their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, were also traduced from some of Old. The first part of their Heresie as yet takes no great place but onely among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the Doctrine opposite unto it being secured by Law, and the Interest of men thereon who have Advantage by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Profession. But yet it is to be feared, that the <hi>Coldness</hi> of many in asserting and defending those Fundamental Doctrines of the Gospel which they oppose, yea their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:204232:95"/> Indifferency about them, and the horrid Notions with strange Expositions that some have embraced and do use concerning the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> do proceed from some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Influence on the Minds of Men which the venome of their Opinions and <hi>Sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Disputes have had upon them. And from a just improvement of their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have proceeded those bold Efforts of Atheistical Imaginations and Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto the Scripture, both the Letter and sence of it, which have of late been divulged in publick Writings, which being brought from the neighbour Nation, do find no slack entertainment by many among us.</p>
               <p>But as to the latter branch of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, or their <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> it hath diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it self among multitudes of Persons who were sometimes of another Perswasion, and have yet Engagements on them so to be. All that unreasonable Advancement of Reason in Matters of Religion which we have amongst us, the new Notions men have of the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the Acknowledgement of it, indeed destructive unto it, the noysome Conceptions of the little use of the Person of Christ in Religion beyond the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:204232:95"/> and Confirmation of the Gospel; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Possibility yea Facility of yielding Acceptable Obedience unto all Evangelical Commands without the Aids of Effectual Grace; of the Powers and Incorruption of our Natures; of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by and upon our own Obedience; of the suitableness of all Gospel Mysteries to unrenewed Reason or an unsanctified Mind; of Regeneration as consisting only in the Reformation of our Lives; with a Rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all internal real Efficacy in convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, and the Substitution of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the room of Grace; with the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of any influences of Grace from Jesus Christ unto the Holiness of Truth; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Opinions wherewith men even pride themselves to the Contempt of the Doctrine received and established in the Reformed Churches of Old, are borrowed out of the Store-houses of their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, shall I say, or raked out of their Dunghill. And whither the Infection may diffuse it self, I know not; The Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the same Bodies substantially, the Subsistence and acting of the Soul in its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate state and Condition, the Eternity of Hell Torments, the Nature of Christs Sacerdotal Office as distinguished from his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:204232:96"/> Regal, begin to be either questioned or very faintly defended amongst many. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other noysome Opinions there are, about the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> his <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> the <hi>two Covenants,</hi> our <hi>Ʋnion with Christ,</hi> the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which some vent as pure My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries and Discoveries of Truth, and value themselves for being the Authors or Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of them, that came all from the same Forge, or are Emanations from the same corrupt Fountain of <hi>Socinianisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have as I suppose sufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated the Truth of what we before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, concerning the <hi>Proneness</hi> and <hi>Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mankind to relinquish and fall off from the Mystery and Doctrine of the Gospel, after it hath been declared unto them, and received by them.</hi> Withall we have stated the Matter of Fact, namely, That such a <hi>Defection</hi> there hath been, and is in the world at this day; the Reasons and Causes whereof we are now to enquire into. Onely I must premise, That the principal Instance designed, and which is among our selves, I have referred to an especial Consideration by it self, wherein we shall enquire into the especial Reasons of it, which are superadded unto those more general, which equally respect Apostasies of this kind.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Reasons and Causes of Apostasie from the Truth or Doctrine of the Gospel, and the Inclination of all sorts of Persons thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in all Ages, enquired into and declared. Ʋncured Enmity in the Minds of many against Spiritual Things, and the Effects of it in a wicked Conversation, the first Cause of Apostasie.</head>
               <p>FOR an Entrance into the ensuing Discourse, I shall lay down that Principle which I presume all men will give their assent unto; namely, <hi>That a Defection from the Truth of the Gospel once professed, is a sin of the highest Guilt, and that which will issue in the most pernicious Events.</hi> God himself did frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain by his Prophets of Old, that his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>had forsaken him,</hi> and were gone away from him; that is, the Doctrine and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of his Law, the onely Means of Conjunction and Communion between him and them. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 20. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 8. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:204232:97"/> 34. 25. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 5. 7. 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 11. To convince them of their horrible Folly and Iniquity herein, he demands of them, <hi>What Iniquity they had seen in him, what Inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his Wayes, what Disappointments they had met withall, that they should grow weary of his Laws and Worship,</hi> so as to relinquish them for such things and wayes as would end in their their Temporal and Eternal Ruine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 25. For if there were nothing in them whereof they had cause to complain, if they were all Holy Just and Good, if in the Observance of them there was great Reward, if by them God did them Good and not Evil all their dayes, there was <hi>no Apology</hi> or Excuse to be made for their Folly and Ingratitude. That so it was with them, that their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Law and Institutions of God, was the highest Folly and greatest Wickedness imaginable, is by all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; yea it will be so by them who at the same time are under a greater Guilt of the same kind. For the Judgements of men are oft-times so bribed by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Interests, or corrupted by the Power of depraved Affections, as to justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in worser Evils than those which they condemn in others.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:204232:97"/>
               <p> But as it was with the People of Old, so it is at present with them who decline from the <hi>Mysteries</hi> or renounce the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Gospel, after they have been received and professed by them, or have done so at any time. Yea, their Guilt hath greater Aggravations than accompanyed the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Revolts of the <hi>Jews</hi> of Old. For the Gospel is a clearer Revelation of God, and much more Glorious than that which was made by the Law. There is therefore no Reason to be taken from it self, why men should desert it, either in its Doctrines and Precepts, or the Worship which it doth require. Nothing can be charged on the Gospel, nothing on any thing contained in it or produced by it, which should counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance any in a Defection from them. It is in it self a blessed Emanation from the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fountain of Wisdom and Truth; and hath more Impressions and Characters upon it of Divine Excellencies, than the whole Creation besides. Neither hath it any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Operations or Effects on the Souls of Men, but what are Means and Causes of deliverance from their Original Apostasie from God, with all the Evil that ensued thereon, which is all that is evil. For the Recovery of lost Mankind from a state of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:204232:98"/> Darkness, Bondage and Misery, into that of Liberty Light and Peace, the present Favour and future Enjoyment of God, with Order and mutual Usefulness in this World whilest they continue therein, is the great and immediate Design of the Truths of the Gospel. Neither is there any thing that is truely good, holy, just, benign or usefull among men, but what is influenced by them, and derived from them. Some there have been indeed, (perhaps in all Ages,) who pretending unto the Liberty of it, have really been Servants of Corruption, and have turned the Grace of God into Lasciviousness. And some have charged the principal Doctrines of it, as those which give men a Discharge from a Necessity of holy Obedience, and the utmost use of their own Endeavours therein. And there are those who being given up to Sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Life, living under the Power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the pursuit of secular Ends, who have no other thoughts of it but what the Devils in the possessed Man had of our Lord Jesus Christ, that it comes to <hi>torment them before their time.</hi> And there are not wanting some who fear no Evil but from the Gospel; who suppose, that the Minds of all men would be serene and peaceable,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:204232:98"/> that all things would be quiet, flourishing and orderly in the World, if the Gospel were out of it. For whatever Disturbances men make themselves, in Envy, Wrath, Malice, Persecution of others, the Guilt and Blame of them shall be charged on the Gospel it self. And it is notoriously known how a false pretence of some Grants made in, and Appointments settled by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, hath been made use of, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance some sorts of men in the crafty Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, and violent Possession of worldly Power Grandeur and Wealth, venting themselves in Ambition, Cruelty, Luxury and Pride of Life. But the Iniquity and Folly of all these Abominations, cursed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices of the Father of Lies and Fountain of Malice, shall be (if God will) elsewhere discovered. At present I shall take it for granted, that in it self it is a glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of Divine Wisdom, Goodness, Grace and Love; neither doth it produce any Effects but whereof God is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Author, and will be the everlasting Rewarder. Wherefore the Reasons and Causes of Apostasie from the part of the Gospel under present Consideration, that is, the <hi>Mysteries</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of its Doctrine, must be searched for in the <hi>Minds</hi> of them
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:204232:99"/> by whom it is forsaken, with the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Furtherances that doe accompany them.</p>
               <p>It is not unnecessary such an Enquiry should be engaged into. For things are in that Posture and Condition in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World in this present Age, that if it should be supposed, that the Lives of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christians do make a due Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Gospel, that the Generality of men were led and influenced into that course of Life and Conversation which they openly pursue, by the Doctrines and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of it, it could scarce stand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with <hi>Heathenish Philosophy,</hi> for Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness unto the Glory of God, and the Good or Advantage of Mankind. It is not therefore the Gospel, but it is Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie from it which hath produced so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deplorable Effects in the World, and which by drenching Mankind in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness make way for their Misery and Ruine. And this in the Vindication of the Gospel will be made in some measure to appear, in the discovery of the Causes and Reasons of this Apostasie. For let men pretend what they please, unless they have first forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Gospel in their Hearts and Minds, they would not, they could not forsake all
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:204232:99"/> Rules of <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> also in their Lives.</p>
               <p>Again, the <hi>Prevalency</hi> of this Defection is so great, and the <hi>Neglect</hi> of Men (either intent on their private Occasions Desires and Interests, or captivated under the Power of it, unto the Approbation of the greatest and most dangerous Evils) so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and shamefull, as that every sincere Attempt to warn them of their Danger, to excite them unto their Duty, or direct them in its Performance, whereby the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of this Product of the Councels of Hell may be obstructed, and themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, ought to have a candid Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all those who have a due regard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Interest of Christ and the Gospel in the World, or the everlasting Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their own Souls.</p>
               <p>These are the general Ends which are aimed at in the ensuing Discourses. And if any one of greater Abilities for this work, shall be hereby provoked, or take occasion from hence to make a more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Enquiry into the Causes and Reasons of that Defection from the Glory and Power of Christian Religion which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in the world, and shall thereon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe more suitable and effectual Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:204232:100"/> for the Healing of this <hi>Epidemical</hi> Distemper, I shall rest abundantly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Success of this Attempt and Essay. And the Reasons which present themselves to my thoughts are these that follow.</p>
               <p>That <hi>rooted Enmity</hi> which is in the Minds of men by Nature unto <hi>Spiritual</hi> things, abiding uncured under the Profession of the Gospel, is the Original and first Spring of this Apostasie. So the Apostle tells us, that the <hi>carnal Mind is Enmity against God, Rom.</hi> 8. 7. that is, unto the Revelation of the Will and Mind of God in Christ, with the Obedience which he requireth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; For of these things doth he there discourse. The Nature of this Enmity, and how it operateth on the Minds of men, I have elsewhere declared at large, and shall not here again insist upon them. It is sufficient unto our present Purpose, that men on various Accounts may take upon them the Profession of the <hi>Truths</hi> of the Gospel, whilest this <hi>Enmity</hi> unto Spiritual things abides uncured, yea Predominant in their Minds. So was it with them of whom the Apostle complains, that under their Profession they manifested themselves by their wicked Lives, <hi>to be Enemies of the</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:204232:100"/>
                  <hi>Cross of Christ, Phil.</hi> 3. 18. As those also who professing <hi>that they know God, do yet in Works deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and to every good work repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, Tit.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p>Thus upon the first Preaching of the Gospel many were convinced of its Truth, and took upon them its Profession, merely on the Account of the <hi>Miracles</hi> that were wrought in its Confirmation, whose Hearts and Minds were not in the least reconciled unto the things contained in it; See <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 23, 24. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>Some are so far prevailed with as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge its Truth, by the Efficacy of its Dispensation as an Ordinance of God for their Conviction and Instruction, and yet not part with their Enmity against it. Thus <hi>John</hi> was among the <hi>Jews</hi> as a <hi>burning and shining Light,</hi> and they rejoyced for a season in his Ministry, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 35. insomuch as the Body of the People were initiated into his Doctrine by the Token and Pledge of it in <hi>Baptisme, Matth.</hi> 3. 5, 6. But though all of them confessed their sins according to his Direction, very few forsook them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Duty.</p>
               <p>When both these concurred, Preaching and Miracles in an eminent manner, as when
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:204232:101"/> our Saviour Preached on his feeding <hi>five thousand with five Barley Loaves and two small Fishes,</hi> being prepared in their Minds by the Miracle they saw, they were so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with his Doctrine about the <hi>Bread of Life that came down from Heaven,</hi> that they cryed out, <hi>Lord give us evermore of this Bread; Joh.</hi> 6. 34. But their Natural <hi>Enmity</hi> unto Spiritual things being yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, upon his procedure to instruct them in Heavenly Mysteries they put in <hi>Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to his Doctrine, <hi>ver.</hi> 41, 52, 60. and immediately forsook both Him and It; <hi>ver.</hi> 66. And our Saviour assigns the Reason of their Defection to have been their <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi> and that it <hi>was not given unto them of the Father to come unto him;</hi> ver. 64, 65. or the Enmity of their carnal Minds was yet unremoved. Hence what they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an hard and unintelligible saying, <hi>ver.</hi> 52, 60. his <hi>true Disciples</hi> understood to be the words of <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> ver. 68.</p>
               <p>In process of time many are prepossessed with Notions of the Truth of the Gospel in their Education, by the outward Means of Instruction that have been applyed unto them. But yet notwithstanding this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they may still abide under the Power of this depravation of their Minds.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:204232:101"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Evangelical Truths</hi> being by these or the like Means entertained in the Minds of men, which are also variously affected with them, they will move and act towards their proper End and Design. And hereof there are three parts.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To take off the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man from <hi>Rest and Satisfaction in it self,</hi> as unto present Peace in the Condition wherein it is, and Hope of future Blessedness by its own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. For neither of these are we ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of in our depraved Apostate state. Wherefore the first Work of the Gospel is to influence, guide, and direct the Minds of men to renounce themselves as to these Ends, and to seek after Righteousness, Life, Peace and Blessedness by Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The <hi>Renovation of our Minds, Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> into the <hi>Image or likeness of God,</hi> is another part of its Design. And this it doth by presenting <hi>spiritual</hi> things unto us, in that Light and Evidence, with that Power and Efficacy, as to transform us into their <hi>likeness,</hi> or to bring the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial <hi>Image</hi> of them upon our whole Souls, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) It <hi>engageth</hi> the <hi>whole Soul</hi> in all its Powers and Faculties, through the whole course of its Activity, or in all it doth, to

                  <hi>live unto God</hi> in all holy Obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
               <p>But when this work, or any part of it is urged on the Consciences and Practice of men, they like it not in any measure. The uncured <hi>Enmity</hi> whereof we speak, riseth up in Opposition unto them all. It begins to suppose that it hath admitted a troublesome <hi>In-mate,</hi> that came in as it were to <hi>sojourn,</hi> and will now be a <hi>Judge.</hi> Whilest the Mind is exercis'd onely about the Notions of Truth in Speculation and Reasonings, it is satisfied and pleased with them. Yea it will come unto a Complyance with its Guidance in <hi>sundry things</hi> and Duties which it may perform, and yet abide upon its old Foundations of <hi>self-sufficiency</hi> and <hi>satisfaction, Mark</hi> 6. 20. But when in pursuit of the Ends before mentioned, the Gospel presseth to take men off wholly from their Old Foundations and Principles of Nature, to work them unto an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Change in Powers, Facultyes, Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Ends, to make them <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> it proves irksome unto that <hi>Enmity</hi> which is predominant in them, which therefore stirreth up all the Lusts of the Mind and the Flesh, all the deceitful Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies of the <hi>Old Man</hi> and Powers of Sin,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:204232:102"/> all carnal and unmortified Affections in opposition unto it. Hence Spiritual Truths are first <hi>neglected,</hi> then <hi>despised,</hi> and at last on easie terms <hi>parted withall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For men by Conviction, and on Ratio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal Grounds or Motives, whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>spiritual</hi> may receive that as Truth, and give an Assent unto it, which when it should be reduced unto Practice, the Will and Affections will not comply withall. So it is said of some, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>It liked them not,</hi> It pleased them not, they approved not of it, to <hi>hold,</hi> retain, or keep <hi>God in their knowledge;</hi> or to continue in that Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of him whereof they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. The in-bred Notions which they had by the Light of Nature, with their Consideration of the works of Creation and Providence, gave them Conceptions and Apprehensions of the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. Hereby they are said to <hi>know God,</hi> as they did with respect to the things mentioned, that is, the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Properties of his Nature, <hi>his eternal Power and Godhead; ver.</hi> 21. This Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, these Notions and Conceptions, did immediately direct them <hi>to glorifie him as God</hi> in holy Worship and Obedience, as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:204232:103"/> it is expressed in the same Verse. But this, through the Depravation of their Minds and Affections <hi>they liked not,</hi> and therefore would not retain this Knowledge of him, but gave themselves up unto all abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Idolatries and brutish Lusts which were inconsistent therewithall, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle at large declares. Wherefore even as unto Divine things that are conveyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by Natural Light, and such as is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydable unto all Mankind, the Will, the Affections, and the practical Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, are more <hi>vitiated</hi> and <hi>corrupted</hi> than are the Preceptive and Directive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Mind. And hence it was that all the World who had nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them but the Light of Nature, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized from its Guidance, and lived in contrariety unto it. They were all <hi>Rebels</hi> against that Light which they had, and so will all Mankind be without the especial Grace of God.</p>
               <p>It is so also with respect unto Truths communicated by <hi>supernatural Revelation.</hi> It is given as the Character of those who were to carry on the <hi>great Apostasie</hi> from the Mysteries and Worship of the Gospel, that they <hi>received not the Love of the Truth that they might be saved,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:204232:103"/> The <hi>Truth</hi> it self as to the Profession of it they did receive and own for a time. But such an Approbation of it, such a Love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it as should encline them unto Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or the improvement of it unto its proper Ends, that so they might be saved, they neither had nor endeavoured after. This made them prone on all Occasions and Temptations to forgoe and relinquish the Profession of it, to change it for the vilest Errors and grossest Superstitions. For in such a posture of Mind, mens Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will prevail against their Convictions. First they will stifle the Truth as to its Operations, and then reject it as to its Profession. Let other Notions be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto them, more suited unto the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Minds or the Sensuality of their Affections, and they will not fail of a ready entertainment.</p>
               <p>There are Instances among all sorts of men, how when they have imbibed <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> even such as are False vain and foolish, and have them riveted in their Minds by powerfull Interests or inveterate Prejudices, neither the Evidence of Truth, nor the Fear of Danger can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them for their Renunciation or Relinquishment. All false wayes in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:204232:104"/> and that of <hi>Mahumetisme,</hi> give us Examples hereof. But we have two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Instances of it, that may well fill the Minds of men with Astonishment: The first is of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who for so many successive Generations, under all manner of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Calamities, continue obstinate in the most irrational Unbelief, and Apostasie from the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> their Forefather, and the Expectation of all their Ancestors, that can enter into the Heart of any man to imagine. For many Generations those who from among them have been so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their Folly, as really and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to embrace the Gospel, do scarce answer one unto a <hi>Century</hi> of years. The other is in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is known how that Communion aboundeth with men otherwise <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>learned,</hi> what Kings and Rulers of the Earth do adhere thereunto. And this they continue to doe, and will do so, notwithstanding that the Errors, Impieties, Superstitions and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of that Church are so many and so manifest. Other Instances there are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently pregnant to evince, that no Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Religion can be so foolish or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, but that some will be found pertinaciously to adhere unto them against
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:204232:104"/> all Endeavours for their Relief, either in the way of God by Rational and Spiritual <hi>Convictions,</hi> or in the Way of the World by <hi>Persecution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be more may and will be found to be Obstinate in <hi>Error</hi> upon Trials with Difficulties, Dangers, and Oppositions, than on the like Trials be constant in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of <hi>the Truth;</hi> I mean among them who together with its <hi>external</hi> Profession have not received its <hi>internal</hi> Power and Efficacy, with the Love of it in their Hearts. For both sorts receive their Notions and Apprehensions of things in the same Way, and on the same Grounds of appearing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, though the Understanding be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on and deceived in the one and not in the other. But Error once received under the Notion of Truth, takes firmer Root in the carnal Minds of Men, than Truth doth or can, whilest their Minds are so carnal. And the Reason of it is, because all <hi>Error</hi> is some way suited unto the Mind as thus depraved, and there is nothing in it that is Enmity thereunto. Neither in it self nor any of its Effects doth the Mind dislike it; for being fallen off from the first Truth and Goodness, it wanders and delights to wander in crooked or by-paths
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:204232:105"/> of its own. For <hi>God made Man upright, but they have sought out many Inventions, Eccles.</hi> 7. 29. These it pleaseth it self withall, and is conformed unto. For there is somewhat in every Error to recommend it self unto the Vanity or Curiosity, or Pride, or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of the carnal Mind. But it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with Evangelical Truths, which the Mind disrelisheth, because of its innate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity unto the things which they propose and exhibit. Hence it is easier for the most part to draw off a thousand from the Profession of it, who have no Experience of its <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> in their Souls, than to turn one from an Erroneous way, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he be confirmed in it by Interest and Prejudice. And so it is at present in the World. Every sort or party of false Professors, as <hi>Papists</hi> and others, do carry off multitudes of common Professors from the Truth which they had owned, but seldom do we hear of any one recovered from their Snares. Nor need any Seducers desire a greater Advantage, than to have admittance unto their work where Persons live in an outward Profession of the Truth, and inward Enmity unto it. They shall be filled with Proselytes unto satiety.</p>
               <p>This was the fundamental Cause of that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:204232:105"/> Apostasie from the Doctrine and Truths of the Gospel, which had prevailed in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the whole visible Church. Had the Generality of men received the Truth <hi>in the Love</hi> thereof, had they not had a secret Enmity in their Hearts and Minds against it, had not things vain curious and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious been suited unto the prevailing Principles of their Minds and Affections, they would not, they could not upon any Suggestions or Temptations, so easily, so universally have forsaken the Gospel for the Traditions of Men, nor gone away from Christ to follow after Antichrist, as we know them to have done. But when an <hi>external Profession</hi> of the Truth became to be transmitted from one Generation to another, the <hi>Spirit and Power</hi> of it being wholly neglected, men did but wait for Opportunities gradually to part with it, and give it up for any thing else that was suggested unto them; many in the mean time setting their Wits on work to find out Inventions suited to their Lusts and corrupt Affections. That it was thus with them who were carried away with the great Apostasie, that they did by all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wayes and means in their Lives and Conversations manifest that so it was with
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:204232:106"/> them, shall be afterwards declared. And had it not been so with them, the Event complained of had not ensued.</p>
               <p>And herein lyes the present danger of the Persons, Churches and Nations, which at this day make Profession of the Gospel. For if a pressing Trial, or vigorous Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if a Coincidence of various wayes and Means of Seduction do befall them who have <hi>received the Truth</hi> but not in the Love and Power of it, they will be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preserved from a general Apostasie. For when any Attempts shall be made from without upon them, they have Treachery from the Deceitfulness of their own Hearts at the same time working in them. For their <hi>uncured Enmity</hi> against the Truth doth but watch for an Opportunity to part with it, and reject it. Any thing that will but free them from the Efficacy of those Convictions, or Power of the Traditions under which they are held captive unto the Profession of the Truth, as it were whether they will no, shall be chearfully embraced and complyed withall. And the Danger hereof doth sufficiently evidence it self in that open dislike of the Rule and Conduct of the Truth, which most men testifie in the whole Course of their Lives.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:204232:106"/>
               <p> It is plain therefore, that unless this <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> be conquered or cast out of the Mind, unless the Mind be freed from its corrupt Agency and Effects, unless the Truth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its real Power and Efficacy upon the Soul, unless it be <hi>so learned as it is in Jesus,</hi> whereby men put off concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conversation the <hi>Old Man which is corrupt according unto deceitfull lusts,</hi> and be <hi>renewed in the spirit of</hi> their <hi>Minds,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on that <hi>New Man which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness;</hi> unless they love and value it for the Effects of spiritual Peace Power and Liberty which it produceth in them, there will be found among them little Constancy or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance in their Profession, when Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations shall concurre with Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for a Revolt. For who can give se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity that what hath formerly fallen out amongst the Generality of Mankind, shall not in any place do so again, where the same Causes of it do again concurre.</p>
               <p>Having discovered this <hi>first Cause of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> from the Gospel, we may easily discern what are the onely true effectual Wayes and Means of the Preservation and Continuance of the true Religion in any place or among any People where it hath
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:204232:107"/> been professed, especially if Temptations unto a Revolt should abound, and the Season be made perillous by advantagious Opportunities: Love of the Truth and Experience of its Power in the Hearts of men will produce this Effect, and nothing else. All other Means where these have been wanting have failed in all places in the World, and will do so again when a time of Trial shall come. True Religion may be established by Law, countenanced by Authority, have a Prescription of a long Profession, or be on other accounts so fixed on the Minds of men, as that multitudes shall promise the firmest Stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the Profession thereof. But there is no Security in things of this Nature; and we shall quickly see all the Hopes that are built upon them vanish into nothing. Convictions or Traditions unto whose Power a secret <hi>Enmity</hi> is retained, may make a bluster and Noyse for a season, but every breath of Temptation will carry them away before it. Were it not so with the most of men, had it been possible that so many Nations in less than an <hi>Age</hi> should fall into <hi>Arianisme,</hi> after the Truth had been so long known and professed among them; or that the Body of this Nation
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:204232:107"/> after a blessed Reformation should again relapse into <hi>Popery,</hi> as in the dayes of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> when many who had professed the Gospel, cast others into Flames who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued so to doe.</p>
               <p>It is greatly complained of, that <hi>Popery</hi> doth encrease in this Nation, and some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press their Fears of its farther prevalency, and that perhaps not without Cause. And although there are several other wayes whereby men may and do <hi>apostatize</hi> from the Truth, yet all those who take any other measure of things, besides their own Secular Interests, with the corrupt Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Minds, in Wrath, Envy, and Revenge, do look on this as far the most dangerous, as that which will be most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant with the predominant Lusts of the present Age, and most comprehensive to receive the Community of Men. Besides, by what it hath done formerly, it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently instructs what it is like enough to doe agian. Wherefore very many industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously attempt its prevention, as that which would prove (if it should prevail) deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ruinous unto the Nation and their Posterity therein. To this end some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Aid of Authority for the enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>severe Laws</hi> for the prohibition of it.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:204232:108"/> This, according to the Opinion of late Ages, some suppose the most effectual Means for the preservation of the Truth. For if they can but destroy all that are otherwise-minded, the <hi>rest of Mankind</hi> will have the face of Peace unto them who are advantaged thereby. Some write <hi>Books</hi> in the Confutation of the Errors of it, and that to very good Purpose. But in the mean time, (if there be any thing of Truth in Reports) the work is as effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive as if no Opposition had been made unto it. And we may assure our selves, that these and such like Means as these, if they are alone, will never keep <hi>Popery</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> if it should ever have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and Opportunity for a Return, nor prevent the Entrance of any other false way in Religion.</p>
               <p>As for the Use and Severity of <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> I meddle not with it, as that which is to be referred to the Wisdom of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours. But I must needs say, it seems not to be unto the Advantage of Truth, or at least not unto the Reputation of them by whom it is professed, that they should no otherwise be able to preserve its station amongst men. Neither can it be Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto any Religion, that where it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:204232:108"/> unto all the Advantages and Rights of Truth, and in the real possession of all outward Emoluments and Supportments, yet that it cannot secure it self or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its Profession without outward Force and Violence, things so remote from the first Introduction and planting of Truth in the World. But these things are not of our present Consideration. For the Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Errors, Superstitions, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous practices of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in Books of Controversie, it is (no doubt) a work good, usefull and necessary in its kind. But when all is done, these things reach but a <hi>few,</hi> nor will many divert from other Occasions to the serious considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. Wherefore, some other way must be fixed on and ingaged in, to secure the Truth and Interest of Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion among us. And this is no other but the effectual Communication of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it unto the Minds, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation of the Power of it on the Hearts of the People. This is that alone which will root out of them that <hi>Enmity</hi> unto Evangelical Mysteries and Spiritual things, which betrayes the Souls of men into Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie.</p>
               <p>Unless men know <hi>what</hi> they are to value
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:204232:109"/> Religion for, and <hi>what Benefit</hi> they really receive by its Profession, it is irrational to expect that they will be <hi>constant</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in when a trial shall befall them. If once they come to say, It is <hi>in vain thus to serve God,</hi> or <hi>what Profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances,</hi> they will easily admit the Yoke of any Falshood or Superstition, that pretends to gratifie them with greater Advantages. And at one time or other it will be no otherwise with them with whom this <hi>Enmity</hi> is predominant.</p>
               <p>But on the other side, when God by the Gospel shines into the Hearts of men, <hi>to give them the Knowledge of his Glory in the face of Jesus Christ;</hi> when they find their Consciences set free thereby from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Yokes of Superstition and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that by the Word of Truth which they do profess, they are begotten anew unto the Hope of Eternal Life, their <hi>inward Man</hi> being renewed, and their <hi>Lives</hi> Reformed thereby; that their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a blessed Immortality is well founded on it, and safely resolved into it; they will through the effectual Supplyes of the Spirit of Christ abide constant in the Profession of it, whatever may befall them.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:204232:109"/>
               <p> On these Terms, on these experienced Evidences of Truth and Goodness was the Gospel first entertained among men, and the Reformation of Religion first intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into this Nation. For although sundry other things concurred unto its Reception and Establishment, yet if the Minds of multitudes had not received an Experience of its Power and Efficacy unto the Ends mentioned, it would never have been of any Permanency among us. The mere outward Form of true Religion is not able to contend with that <hi>Appearance</hi> which Error and Superstition will repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto the Minds of Men, as knowing how much they stand in need thereof.</p>
               <p>These things I know are by some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised. They suppose they have surer Wayes, and better Expedients for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Profession of the Gospel amongst us, than its own Power and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. What those Wayes are we need not conjecture, seeing themselves declare them continually, but they shall not be here spoken unto. But it is to be feared that they may be filled with the Fruit of their own Imaginations when those things shall fail them wherein they have placed their Confidence. Wherefore, if there be
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:204232:110"/> a Neglect about these things in the Ministry, and others whose Duty it is to promote them, the Issue will be sad, it may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what is feared. For if the Body of the People be suffered to live without any Evidence of an Acquaintance with the Power of that Truth which they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, or any demonstrative Fruits of it in a holy Conversation, we may cry out, <hi>Popery, Popery,</hi> as long as we please, when Temptations, Opportunities, and Interests do concurre, their Profession will fall from them as dry leaves from a Tree when they are moved with the wind. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us, that those <hi>who went out from them were never of them,</hi> for if they had <hi>been of them</hi> they would <hi>have continued with them,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. They were <hi>among</hi> them by the Profession of the Truth, or they could not have gone out <hi>from</hi> them. But they were <hi>never of them</hi> in the Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the <hi>Power</hi> of the Truth, and <hi>Communion thereby with the Father and the Son;</hi> for if they had, they would have <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi> with them, that is, steadfast in their Profession.</p>
               <p>This is that which ought to be fixed on the Minds of all persons concerned, of all that are zealous for the Truth of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:204232:110"/>
                  <hi>Religion,</hi> or are obliged, what lyes in them, to provide for its preservation. When things are come unto the appointed Season, when they are issuing in that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod which they have a natural tendency unto, all other Expedients and Devices will be of none Effect. A diligent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication unto the Body of the People through the Dispensation of the Word, or Preaching of it, the <hi>Power</hi> of the Truth they profess in all its blessed Effects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they will have an Experience and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness within themselves, of the Reasons why they ought to abide <hi>constantly</hi> in its Profession, will alone secure the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Gospel in succeeding Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. All other Means will be ineffectual unto that End; and so far as without this they are or may be effectual, it will be of no advantage unto the Souls of men.</p>
               <p>That there is a <hi>danger</hi> at all times of a Defection among professed Christians from the Truth, hath been before evinced. That this Danger at present hath many especial Circumstances rendring it dangerous in a peculiar manner, is in like manner acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all such as call these things into serious consideration. And it will not (I presume.) be denyed, but that every man
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:204232:111"/> according as he is called and warranted by especial Duty, is obliged to his utmost Endeavours for the Prevention of a Revolt from the Truth. The whole Enquiry is, What is the best Way, Means, or Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be plyed unto this End. And this, I say, is onely by the diligent Ministerial Dispensation of the Word, with such an exemplary Zeal and Holiness in them by whom it is dispensed, and all other things requisite unto the Discharge of that work, as may reconcile the Hearts of the People unto <hi>Evangelical</hi> Truths, beget in them a <hi>delight</hi> in Obedience, and implant the <hi>Power</hi> of the Word in their whole Souls. Want hereof was that which lost the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel in former Ages, and will do so where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, in this or those which are to come. And I shall not in my own thoughts blameably digress from my present Subject, if I confirm this Opinion with some few obvious Considerations. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the Way, <hi>the onely Way</hi> which God hath <hi>ordained</hi> and which he <hi>blesseth</hi> to this End and Purpose. None will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, as I suppose, that God hath appointed any other Way to bring men unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Truth, but by the Preaching and Dispensation of the Word alone. When
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:204232:111"/> they are wrought upon or convinced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, so as to give up themselves unto the Profession of it, it will be hard to find an Ordinance of God of another kind for their Preservation therein. When the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle took his last Farewell of them who were converted by his Ministry at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he <hi>commended them to the Word of Gods Grace, which</hi> (as he judged) <hi>was able to build them up, and give them an Inheritance among them that are sanctified,</hi> Acts 20. 32.</p>
               <p>A man would think it were a more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult work to convert men from <hi>Judaisme,</hi> or <hi>Paganisme,</hi> any false Religion, unto the Profession of the Gospel, than to retain them in that Profession when they are initiated thereinto. For in that first Work there are all sorts of Prejudices and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to be conflicted withall; and not the least advantage from any acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Principles of Truth. But as to the Preservation of men in the Profession of the Truth which they have received and owned, the Work on many Accounts seems to be more expedite and easie. If therefore the Dispensation of the Word as it is Gods Ordinance unto that end, hath been a sufficient and effectual Means for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:204232:112"/> the <hi>former,</hi> what Reason can be assigned that it should not be so for the <hi>latter</hi> also, without farther Force or Violence?</p>
               <p>It will be said, that the first Preachers of the Gospel were furnished with <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifts,</hi> whereby their Ministry was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>effectual</hi> unto the first Conversion of the Nations. But whereas now those Gifts do cease, the Efficacy of the Ministry doth so also, and therefore stands in need of such <hi>outward</hi> Assistances as the former did not. I say, for my part, I wish it all the Assistance which those unto whom it is committed can desire, so that no Force be offered to the Consciences or Persons of other Men. But why shall we not think that the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifts</hi> of the Ministry are as sufficient for the <hi>ordinary Work</hi> of it, as the <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> were for that which was <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary?</hi> To speak the truth, the Difference lyeth in <hi>Persons</hi> in the discharge of their Duty, and not in the things, Gifts or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themselves. Were all those who are Called, or prosess themselves to be Called unto the Preservation of the Truth of the Gospel in the Work of the Ministry, as conscientiously diligent in the discharge of their Duty, as well fitted according to the Rules of the Gospel with those ordinary
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:204232:112"/>
                  <hi>spiritual</hi> Gifts which are necessary unto their Work and Calling; did as fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Design and Nature of their Message unto men in an holy Conversation, as those first appointed unto the Conversion of the Nations were, and did, according to their larger Measures of Grace and Gifts; the Work would have a proportionate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in their hands unto what it had in the Beginning. But whilest those unto whom this Charge is committed, do neglect the Use of this Means which is the Ordinance of God unto this purpose, that the Truths of the Gospel be preserved amongst men, whilest either they judge that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal End of their Office is to capacitate them for Secular Advantages, and to give them outward Rest therein, with the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those things which unto the most in this World seem desireable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall think meet to betake themselves unto other Expedients for the Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Truth, which God hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed nor sanctified to that End, it is no wonder if Faith and Truth fail from amongst men.</p>
               <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> foresaw that a Time would come, wherein some men would <hi>not endure endure sound Doctrine, but after</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:204232:113"/>
                  <hi>their own hearts lusts</hi> would <hi>heap up unto themselves Teachers, having itching Ears,</hi> who should <hi>turn them away from the Truth, and turn them unto Fables;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4. And we may see what Course he prescribeth for the Prevention of this Evil, that it might not proceed unto a <hi>general Apostasie.</hi> It must also be observed, that the Advice he gives in this Case, though Originally directed unto one individual Person who was immediately concerned, yet it lyes in Charge on all that are or shall be called unto the Rule of, or Ministry in the Church. This Course he proposeth <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2, 5. of that Chapter. <hi>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead, at his Appearing and his Kingdom, Preach the Word, be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and Doctrine, watch in all things, endure Afflictions, do the work of an Evangelist, make full proof of thy Ministry.</hi> This is that Course and Way which he prescribeth for the Preservation of the Truth against the Corruptions of mens Minds and the Craft of Seducers. And the Charge of this Duty he giveth with so great a Solemnity, and urgeth with so many Motives emphatically expressed, as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:204232:113"/> manifest of how great moment he conceived it to be.</p>
               <p>Perhaps this way of the preservation of the Truth, and the Salvation of the Souls of Men by continual <hi>labouring in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> with an undergoing of all those Difficulties which attend it, is not esteemed so adviseable as formerly. For what Good would mens Lives or Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe unto them, if they should be obliged thus to labour in this <hi>sweaty kind of Preaching?</hi> But if it be so, they must at one time or another be contented to part with the Truth and all the Advantages they have by the Profession of it. For let men turn themselves which way they please, let them traverse their Methods, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply their Councels to secure Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Apprehension, however they may hereby chain their Idols as the Heathens did their Gods of Old, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their departure from them, and fix a Profession of Lyes, the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel as unto any usefull End of it will be no otherwise preserved in a Nation, Church or People, but by this Means of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is such a Way and Expedient for the Preservation of the Truth and the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:204232:114"/> Profession of the Gospel, as none can have the Impudence to complain of, or except against. There is in all places, among all sorts of Persons, a pretence of Zeal for the retaining of what they conceive to be the Truth, or Right in Religion. But the Wayes which for the most part they have chosen unto that purpose, have been full of Scandal unto <hi>Christian Religion:</hi> So far from being Rational Means of preserving men in it, as that they are effectual to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre them from it. Such is that <hi>outward Force</hi> which hath been now tryed in this Nation, as elsewhere by all sorts of Persons; and wise men may easily observe what it is arrived unto. In the mean time it is openly evident, that let the End aimed at be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so Good, the Means used for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it are accompanyed with much Evil. What peace or Satisfaction they have in themselves who are the <hi>Prosecutors</hi> of this way, I know not. It is above my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to apprehend that the Minds of any Christians can be thoroughly at ease, rejoycing in God through Jesus Christ, whilest they cause others to be terrified, pursued, ruined and destroyed, meerly for that which is their Faith and Hope in Christ Jesus. But I know not the Principles of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:204232:114"/> the Minds of other men, the Make or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of their Consciences, nor the Rules of their walking before God, much less their prevailing Prejudices and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests that influence them beyond all evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Reason to the contrary; and therefore they may have a satisfactory peace in this way, though I understand not how. On the other side, those who are practised upon, and forced to suffer in this Course of proceeding, are filled with <hi>Alienation</hi> from them and their profession by whom they suffer. Hence it is known what mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Animosities, Hatreds, Contentions, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reflections and dreadfull Scandals this way is attended withall. We see at this day what Clamours and Contests are raised about it, what pleas are managed against such procedures, how uncouth it is unto Humane Nature, to suffer all Extremities for that which men are fully perswaded they deserve well in of Mankind; nor can any man give Assurance, but that at one time or other the Wheat shall be plucked up instead of Tares.</p>
               <p>But as to the way now proposed, of preserving the Truth by the diligent, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Dispensation of the Word of the Gospel unto the generality of the People
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:204232:115"/> who can pretend a provocation by it, or take offence at it? <hi>No mortal man</hi> will be prejudiced by it in any thing that he dares own a Concernment in. The <hi>Devil</hi> indeed will be enraged at it, not onely as that which is designed unto the ruine of his Interest and Kingdom in the issue, but as that wherein he hath no share, nor can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose his Endeavours. For he is a Spirit as <hi>restless</hi> and <hi>active</hi> as he is <hi>malitious,</hi> and loves not to be excluded out of any Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that is on foot in the world. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although he equally hates the Truth in the Management of all men, yet in the way of <hi>preserving</hi> of it before mentioned, he can and doth so apparently immix him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his effectual workings, that he is very well satisfied with it; For what he may possibly lose on the one hand in point of <hi>Truth,</hi> he gains ten times more on the other in the loss of <hi>Love, Peace, Holiness,</hi> with all the Fruits of Goodness, Meekness and Benignity, which ought to be among men. And let him have but his hand ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually in the promotion of this <hi>loss,</hi> and have the contrary Fruits to feed upon, he is little concerned with the Profession of Truth in this or that Way of Worship amongst men. Be it therefore that he is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:204232:115"/> or will be enraged at this way of <hi>preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Truth, we know that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ will be no otherwise main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the world but by a Conquest of his Rage. And for those who mannage the same design with him, their Wrath and Envy which they dare not manifest, will but torment and consume themselves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Setting aside some few Instances of <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> consuming the Persons of men, as among the <hi>Waldenses, Bohemians,</hi> and some others, which yet were never totally prevalent; and Revolutions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment attended with the like Cruelties as in the dayes of <hi>Queen Mary</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which was but of short continuance; no Instance can be given of the Defection of any Church or Nation from the Truth, but where there was a neglect of implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>power</hi> of the Gospel on the Minds and Hearts of men by those unto whom that Charge is committed. This sinfull Neglect was that which constantly opened the Door unto all Apostasie. Wherefore, on this Foundation the weight of all use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Profession of the Gospel among us doth depend. And if God will be pleased to put it into the Hearts of all them who are concerned in this Duty, to labour ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:204232:116"/> therein, and to give unto the People an Example of the <hi>power</hi> of the Gospel, in their own holy humble usefull fruitfull Conversation among them, and shall be pleased moreover to furnish them with the <hi>Gifts of his Spirit,</hi> enabling them unto a successefull discharge of their Duty, Evangelical Truth would certainly receive an unconquerable Establishment among us. And it may be it is not suited unto the Exigence of this Season, that any of those who are called and enabled unto this work, being willing to engage their utmost in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Truth, especially in this way of its <hi>preservation,</hi> by leavening the Minds of men with a sence of its <hi>power</hi> and <hi>worth,</hi> should be prohibited the discharge of their Duty. But the Purposes of God in all things must stand, and himself be humbly adored, where his <hi>Judgements are unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and his <hi>Wayes past finding out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, This innate and yet uncured <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> unto things <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Cause and Means of <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the Truths of the Gospel, by filling the Hearts of men with a <hi>Love of Sin,</hi> and their Lives with the Fruits of it in <hi>wicked Works.</hi> For men are <hi>alienated, and enemies in their minds</hi> in <hi>or</hi> by <hi>wicked works; Col.</hi> 1. 21.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:204232:116"/> The Enmity which is in their Minds doth operate and manifest it self in wicked works. And the Alienation wherewith this Enmity is accompanyed, is from <hi>the Life of God; Eph.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Having the Ʋnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darkened, being alienated from the Life of God;</hi> that is, the spiritual heavenly Life of Faith and Holiness, which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and whereof he is the End and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Of this Life the Truths of the Gospel are the Spring, Rule, and Measure; See <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 24. Wherefore, when men are <hi>alienated from the Life of God,</hi> and through the Love of Sin are given up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>wicked works,</hi> they cannot but secretly dislike and <hi>hate</hi> that Truth, that Spiritual and Heavenly Doctrine which is the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of Holiness, and whereby both the <hi>Love of Sin</hi> and the Fruits of it in <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Works,</hi> are everlastingly condemned. Let then men pretend and profess what they please, whilest this <hi>Enmity</hi> is in them as a predominant Principle of Sin and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Conversation, they are <hi>practically</hi> and <hi>really</hi> Enemies unto the Gospel it self. And where any persons are so, it is easily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, how ready and prone they will be to part with it on any Occasion. For none will retain that in their Minds which
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:204232:117"/> is <hi>useless</hi> to them, and <hi>troublesome</hi> unto their principal Inclinations, any longer than they have a fair Opportunity to part with it. That this Frame of Mind is an effectual Obstruction unto the <hi>due receiving</hi> of the Gospel, our Saviour expressely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19, 20. <hi>This is the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that light is come into the World, and men loved darkness rather than light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their deeds were evil. For every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh unto the light, lest his deeds should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</hi> Wherever the <hi>power</hi> of Sin abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and men are engaged in the <hi>practice</hi> of it, so as that their <hi>deeds are evil,</hi> they will not receive the Light of the Gospel; that is, in its own Nature and Power, and for its proper Ends. And when they are by Conviction or any other Means wrought unto a complyance with it, yet they do it but <hi>partially</hi> and <hi>hypocritically,</hi> nor can do it otherwise whilest their deeds are Evil. So was it with them who are said to <hi>believe in Christ,</hi> being some way convinced of the Truth of his Doctrine, yet would they not <hi>confess him,</hi> because <hi>they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God; Joh.</hi> 12. 42, 43. By the reigning Power of this one sin of ambitious Hypocrisie, most of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:204232:117"/> them were kept off from any assent unto the Gospel, as our Saviour speaks unto them, <hi>How can you believe which receive honour one of another, and seek not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which cometh from God only; Joh.</hi> 5. 44. With the residue who were not able wholly to withstand their Convictions, it prevailed so far as that they should not receive it <hi>sincerely</hi> but <hi>partially</hi> and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically. Now that which so effectually keeps the most from giving any <hi>Admission</hi> at all unto the Gospel, and which suffers none to receive it in a <hi>due Manner,</hi> will easily prevail where it abides in its <hi>power</hi> unto a total Relinquishment of it when Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is offered.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that all those whose <hi>deeds are evil,</hi> who through the Enmity that is in their Minds do give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their Lives unto <hi>wicked Works,</hi> are really alienated from the Truths of the Gospel, they are and will be ready at all times for a Defection from them. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept under the Dominion of Sin, they have no real Benefit by them, but rather find them inconsistent with their principal Interests and chiefest Joys.</p>
               <p>Hence is that Description which the Apostle giveth of those who were Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelically
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:204232:118"/> converted unto God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17, 18. <hi>God be thanked that you were the servants of Sin, but you have obeyed from the Heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you; being then made free from Sin, ye became the servants of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> There is no Obedience from the Heart unto the Gospel, no possibility of being cast into the Mould of the Doctrine delivered in it, unless we be made free from the service of Sin.</p>
               <p>We may therefore without scruple fix this as one principal Means and Cause of that Apostasie from the Truth of the Gospel which hath been in the World, and which is yet deplorably progressive. Men who <hi>love Sin,</hi> and <hi>live in Sin,</hi> whose Works are wicked, and whose Deeds are evil, are all of them in their Hearts alienated from the spiritual holy Doctrines of the Gospel, and will undoubtedly on any Occasion of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation or Trial, fall away from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of them.</p>
               <p>What reason have we to hope or judge, that Drunkards, Swearers, unclean Persons, Covetous, Proud, Ambitious, Boasters, vain Sensualists, and the like Enemies of the Cross of Christ, should adhere unto the Truth with any Constancy if a Trial should
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:204232:118"/> befall them. <hi>Look diligently,</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>lest there be any Fornicator or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane person as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his Birth-right; Heb.</hi> 12. 16. <hi>Esau</hi>'s Birth-right was his Right unto and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the Promise of the Gospel made unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> This he being a prophane Person, when he was pressed with a little hunger, parted withall, for one <hi>morsel of Meat.</hi> And if others, saith the Apostle, are like him, prophane persons, Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or such as live in any Course of Sin, if a Temptation befall them, and their Lusts call to be satisfied, they will for <hi>morsels of Bread,</hi> for the smallest earthly Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, part with their Interest in and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Gospel. So he tells us of them who having <hi>put away a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> did make <hi>shipwrack of the Faith;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. After men have debauched their Consciences by living in Sin, they may for a while speed on their Voyage with full Sails of Profession; but if a Storm comes, if a Trial befall them, if they meet with a Rock or Shelve in their way, they quickly <hi>make Shipwrack of the Faith,</hi> and lose <hi>that</hi> whatever else they labour to preserve.</p>
               <p>What should secure such Persons unto any Constancy in Profession? for whilest
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:204232:119"/> they are in this Condition, it is altogether indifferent unto them, as to their present or future Advantage, what Religion they are of; or whether they are of any at all or no. It is true, one way of Religion may more harden them in Sin, lay more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices against and hindrances of their Conversion, than another. But no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can do them good, or yield them the least eternal Advantage whilest they abide in that Condition. It will be all one at the last day what Religion wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sinners have been of; unless it be that the Profession of the Truth will prove an Aggravation of their Sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Besides, when a Temptation unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishment of the Truth doth befall them, it hath nothing but a few Traditional pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices to contend withall. When they are taken off from them, and begin to search themselves for Reasons why they should adhere unto the Truth which they have outwardly professed, they quickly find in their own hearts a predominant dislike and hatred of that Light and Truth which they are sollicited to part withall. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, as our Saviour testifieth, <hi>hateth the Light,</hi> whose deeds are evil.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:204232:119"/>
               <p> This is that which abroad in the world hath lost the Gospel so many <hi>Princes, Nobles,</hi> and great Men, who for a while made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it. This is that which is of such dismal abode at this day, as to the danger of a general Apostasie. All sorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons do give up themselves unto the service of Sin. The Complaint of the Prophet is not unsuited to our Occasion, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1, 4, 5, 6. Many are openly flagitious, beyond President or Example among the Heathen: Worldliness, Pride, Ambition, Vanity, in all its variety of Occasions and Objects with Sensuality of Life, have even over-run the world. And that which is of the most dreadfull consideration, is that the sins of many are accompanyed with the highest Aggravation of all Provocations; namely, that they <hi>proclaim</hi> them like <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hide them not, but glory in their <hi>shame.</hi> In all these things men do really though not in words proclaim that they are weary of the Gospel, and are ready to leave it, some for any pretence of Religion, some for none at all.</p>
               <p>And this is the most dangerous Posture that any Place, Church, or People can be found in. For whereas men are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ready and prone unto a <hi>spiritual</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:204232:120"/> and Defection; when this ariseth from and is promoted by the Love of Sin, and a Life therein, God is ready also penally to give them up unto such Delusions, as shall turn them off from the Gospel. So the Apostle expresseth it; 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>They received not the love of the Truth that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong Delusions that they should believe a lye; that they all might be damned who believed not the Truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</hi> Where men under the Profession of the Truth will continue profligate in Sin, and taking pleasure in Unrighteousness, God will not alwayes suffer the Gospel to be prostituted to give them Countenance in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but will Judicially give them up unto such Delusions, as shall flood them away into an open Apostasie from it.</p>
               <p>This was the great Cause of that general and almost <hi>Catholick</hi> Apostasie that was in the World before the Reformation. The Body of the Christian People, by such Means and on such Occasions as shall be afterwards declared, were grown worldly, sensual, wicked and Obstinate in sin. The Complaints hereof are left on Record in the Writings of many in those dayes. And
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:204232:120"/> in vain it was for any to attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them unto a Conformity unto the Gospel, especially considering that the most of their Guides were no less Infected than themselves. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> was almost the only person, at least he was the most eminent who set himself in his Ministry to stemme (if it were possible) the rising Tide of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and Wickedness among all sorts of persons. But instead of any success, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Endeavours ended in his own Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Death. All Degrees and Orders of men undertook the Patronage of publick sinning, against him, and to his ruine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there remained but two wayes of dealing with the Generality of men in such a condition. The one was, according to the advice of the Apostle, to <hi>turn away or withdraw from them;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. so leaving them out of the Communion of the Church. The other was, to accommodate Religion unto their Temper and Lusts, whereby a Face and Appearance of Christianity might be preserved among them. And the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of their Leaders preferring their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest before their Duty, the <hi>latter</hi> way was chosen and gradually promoted.</p>
               <p>Hence were Opinions and Practices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, advanced, and taken into Religion,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:204232:121"/> that might accommodate men in their Lusts, or give countenance and pretended relief unto them who were resolved to live in their sins. Such were <hi>Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, Penances, Absolutions, Commutations of all sorts, Missatical Sacrifices</hi> for the Living and the Dead, the Churches Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of <hi>Merit,</hi> and Power of <hi>Pardon,</hi> Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage and Help of <hi>Saints,</hi> especially <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> with all its Appendages.</p>
               <p>Hereby was the <hi>Apostasie</hi> compleated; for men being grown carnal and <hi>wicked,</hi> there appeared no way to keep them up unto the Profession of the Gospel, but by the corrupting the whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> of it, that their Lusts might be some way accommodated. To this End, <hi>external</hi> things were substituted in the room of things <hi>internal,</hi> having the same Names given unto them; <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> things in the room of things <hi>Spiritual;</hi> outward Offices, Orders, and multiplyed Sacraments with their Efficacy by vertue of the work wrought, in the place of real Conversion unto God, Purity of Heart, with strict uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Holiness; <hi>Disciplines</hi> and corporeal Severities, in the room of Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Mortification. Nor could the Lusts of men have possibly an higher
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:204232:121"/> Accommodation whilest any pretence of Religion was necessary to be preserved. So formerly did Wickedness of Life lead the way into Apostasie from the Truth. And the whole of the <hi>Papal</hi> Apostasie may be reduced unto these two heads. First an Accommodation of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of the Gospel unto the <hi>carnal Minds</hi> and <hi>Lusts</hi> of men, with the <hi>state</hi> of their Consciences that ensued thereon. And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Accommodation of the <hi>Lusts, Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> of men, unto the <hi>Interests</hi> and <hi>worldly Advantage</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergy.</p>
               <p>And herein lyeth the Danger of this Age. The great Design of the generality of men is to <hi>live in Sin</hi> with as little Trouble at <hi>present,</hi> and as little Fear of what is <hi>future</hi> as they can arrive unto. And there are but two Wayes whereby such a Posture of Mind may be attempted.</p>
               <p>The one is by Obliterating all <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> all <hi>Sense</hi> of future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments, or of Gods Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World. This some in all Ages have endeavoured. For <hi>the Fool hath said in his heart there is no God:</hi> And thereon are <hi>they corrupt, and doe abominable works; Psal.</hi> 14. 1. And no Age could
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:204232:122"/> ever give more Instances of this affected <hi>Atheisme</hi> than that wherein we live. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do any deceive themselves into it, but meerly with this Design, to Live in Sin without Controll from themselves, which is the last Restraint they can acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of. And some of them do please themselves with the Attainment of them in the <hi>Psalmist: The Wicked through the Pride of his Countenance will not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts; Psal.</hi> 10. 4. But God hath in-laid the Minds of men, antecedently unto all Actings of their Wills and Affections, with such a tenacious and unanswerable <hi>Witness</hi> to the contrary, that it is very difficult for any to bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto any tolerable Satisfaction this way. For <hi>that which may be known of God is manifest in themselves</hi> whether they will or no; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. Neither can they free themselves from prevailing Apprehensions, that <hi>it is the judgement of God, that they who commit Sin are worthy of Death,</hi> vers. 32. Wherefore we have not many Instances of men who pretend a sencelesness of these things out of Principle, or that they find no disquietment on the account of Sin. And by the most of them this is but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: Their <hi>ouward Boasting</hi> is but a sorry
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:204232:122"/> Plaister for their <hi>inward Fears</hi> and <hi>Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Nor will the pretended Security of such impious Persons endure the Shock of the least of those Surprizals, Calamities and Dangers which Humane Nature is obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto in this Life, much less of Death it self. The End therefore mentioned, be it never so earnestly desired, is not this way to be attained.</p>
               <p>Another Way therefore must be found out unto the same End, and this must be by <hi>a Religion.</hi> Nothing but Religion can convert men from Sin, and nothing but Religion can secure them therein. To this purpose is that of our Apostle; <hi>In the last dayes perillous times shall come; for men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, proud, blasphemers, disobedient unto Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, unthankfull, unholy, without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affection, Truce-breakers, false Accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traytors, heady, high-minded, lovers of Pleasures more than Lovers of God, having a Form of Godliness, but denying the Power thereof.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Had they the <hi>Power</hi> of Religion in them, they could not give themselves up unto the pursuit of such brutish Lusts; and had they not some Form or other of it, they could not be secure in their Practice. For,</p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:204232:123"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> are stubborn in their Conflict whilest immediately opposed; <hi>Conscience</hi> pleading that there should be no Sin; and <hi>Sin</hi> contending that there may be no Conscience: But as Nature is corrupted they will both comply with an Accommodation. Wherefore a device to <hi>satisfie</hi> Sin, and to <hi>deceive</hi> Conscience, will not fail of a ready Entertainment. And this is the Design in part or in whole of every false Way in Religion that men Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statize into from the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>simplicity</hi> of the Gospel. See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18, 19. One Way or other is proposed to take men off from the Necessity of Regeneration, and the Renovation of their Nature into the <hi>Image</hi> of God in the first place. For this is that <hi>Lyon</hi> in the way, which deterrs all sorts of <hi>sluggards</hi> from attempting any thing seriously in Religion. And whereas our Lord Jesus Christ hath placed the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it on the first entrance into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; there is no false Way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but its first Design is to destroy its <hi>Nature,</hi> or take away its <hi>Necessity.</hi> Hence some would have it to be onely <hi>Baptisme</hi> with the Grace it conferrs by the work wrought. Some substitute <hi>a Moral Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of Life in the room of it, which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:204232:123"/> (as they suppose) is sufficiently severe. And the <hi>Light within</hi> makes all thoughts of it useless. For if this point be not well secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all ensuing Attempts to accommodate men with a Religion will be in vain. It will still be returning on them, that unless <hi>they are born again,</hi> they cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. Internal Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Person, the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Motions of Sin that are in the Flesh, with that Universal Obedience which is required unto the Life of God, must also be provided for or against, and yet Conscience be satisfied therewithall. Wherefore, if you can obtain, that Persons who live in Sin, and are resolved so to do, not troubling themselves about these things, shall suppose that they may be secured eternally in such a Way of Religion as you propose unto them; that what is wanting in themselves shall be done for them by <hi>Absolutions</hi> and <hi>Masses,</hi> and various Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes out of the <hi>Churches Treasury,</hi> with the great Reserve of <hi>Purgatory</hi> when things come to the worst; there is no great fear, (especially if some other Circumstances fall in also to promote the Design,) but that you will find them very Ductile and pliable unto your desires. Add hereunto, that the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:204232:124"/> Wayes whereby any may be interested in these Efficacious Means of Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, namely, by <hi>Confession, Penances</hi> and <hi>Alms,</hi> are possible, yea easie to Persons who never intend to leave their Sins. Of this sort are the most of those visibly who eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day fall off to the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> And it were to be desired, that the Wickedness of men did not give Grounds of fearing Additions to their Number. For if there be no Assurance of the <hi>Constancy</hi> of men in the Profession of the Truth, unless their Souls and Lives are transformed into the <hi>Image</hi> of it, (as there is not,) certainly these Wayes wherein men are furiously ingaged in the pursuit of their Lusts, must needs be <hi>perillous,</hi> and may without the espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Help of Divine Grace bring forth a <hi>fatal Defection.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Darkness and Ignorance, another Cause of Apostasie.</head>
               <p>THE second Spring or Cause of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Gospel in any kind, is that Spiritual <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> which abides in the Minds of Men under the Profession of the Truth.</p>
               <p>The Gospel may fall under a double Consideration: First, Of the <hi>Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> that are contained, revealed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed therein. These are the material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Faith. Secondly, With respect unto the <hi>Doctrinal way</hi> of their <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> With respect unto the <hi>first</hi> there is a Spiritual <hi>Darkness</hi> on the Minds of all men by Nature, so as that they cannot discern them in their own <hi>native</hi> Form and Beauty. With respect unto the <hi>latter</hi> men are said to be <hi>ignorant,</hi> namely, when they do not in a due manner understand and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Gospel; and so
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:204232:125"/> perish for want of Knowledge. These things being of a distinct Consideration, and of different Influence into this perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Event, the first shall be first spoken unto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is such a <hi>spiritual Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> on the Minds of men by Nature, and wherein their Depravation by Sin doth principally consist, is fully testified in the Scripture, as I have at large elsewhere evinced. Hence all men grant, so far as I know, that there is need of <hi>spiritual Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> to enable us to discern Spiritual things in a due Manner, though all are not agreed in the Nature and Causes of that Illumination. But to deny the thing it self, is to deny the Gospel, and to make the Promises of God of none effect. Now where <hi>Illumination</hi> is needfull, there Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is to be removed. For, the end of the bringing in of Light is to dispell Darkness. Wherefore such a Depravation of the Minds of men in spiritual Darkness must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, or the Gift and Grace of God in <hi>Illumination</hi> must be rejected. And they by whom it is done, doe by their own Blindness give new Evidence unto the Truth which they doe oppose; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more certain Demonstration of the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:204232:125"/> Power of Darkness in any, than for them to affirm that they stand in no need of Light to be communicated unto them by the effectual Operations of the Spirit of God. As to the Nature of this Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I shall not here dispute, but take it at present for granted, that it is <hi>an Act of his Power who of old commanded Light to shine out of Darkness, shining into our hearts, to give us the knowledge of his glory in the face of Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Glory and Beauty</hi> in those <hi>spiritual things</hi> which are the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the Truths of the Gospel. There is in them the <hi>wisdom</hi> of God, the <hi>Wisdom of God in a Mystery,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7. yea, <hi>the manifold Wisdom of God, Ephes.</hi> 3. 10. The <hi>Glory of the Lord;</hi> which is represented unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in <hi>the Glass</hi> of the Gospel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. or <hi>the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, Chap.</hi> 4. 6. Things expressely beyond discovery by the use of any means meerly Natural whatever, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. Even the <hi>Philosophers</hi> of old contended that there was a <hi>Beauty</hi> in all Truth, which would engage the Minds and Affections of men unto it, were they able to discern it. And if they saw and granted this in things Natural and Moral, which are Earthly and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:204232:126"/> exposed unto the common Reason of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, how much more must it be granted of the Truth of things Heavenly, Spiritual and Divine. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 12. In brief, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is of divine Glory or Excellency in the Divine Nature it self, in any or all of its holy Properties, in the great and most glorious Effect of them in the Person and Grace of Christ, in the Renovation of our Nature unto the <hi>Image</hi> of God, in the divine Life of Faith and Obedience, it is proposed unto us in the Truths of the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whatever <hi>Doctrinal Proposition</hi> may be made of these things unto the minds of Men, yet the things themselves cannot be comprehended nor Spiritually discerned without the <hi>Illumination</hi> of the Holy Ghost before mentioned. Hence it follows, that men may be instructed in the Doctrines of Truth, yet continuing under the Power of Natural Darkness, not discern the things themselves in their own spiritual Nature and Glory, nor have any Experience of their Power and Efficacy. This all the Prayers of holy men in the Scripture for spiritual Light and Instruction, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God savingly to enlighten the Minds of men, and the Descriptions given
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:204232:126"/> of that work of his Grace whereby he doth effect it, do undenyably evince. One Consideration will be sufficient unto our purpose. Whoever hath a <hi>spiritual</hi> View and Knowledge of these things, his Mind will be and is certainly <hi>changed and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> into the Image of them. So the Apostle tells us expressely; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a Glass the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image.</hi> They are cast into the same mould with the Doctrine whereunto they are given up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. The Mind is united unto the things so discerned, and the Image of them is so brought forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as that there is an exact Conformity between them. But we see by open and palpable Experience, that notwithstanding the Knowledge which many have of <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> things, their Minds continue Carnal and Fleshly, filled with corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Affections and are no way changed into the Image or Likenesse of the things themselves. There needs no farther De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration that men have never had a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> view of, or insight into the Glory of Gospel Truths, be their Doctrinal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them what it will, than this, that their Minds are not renewed thereby,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:204232:127"/> nor transformed into the Likenesse of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where it is thus with men, they have no <hi>stable Grounds</hi> whereon to abide in the Profession of the Truth against <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Opposition,</hi> or <hi>Seduction.</hi> For their <hi>sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness</hi> must be an Effect of such an Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in their Minds of the Truth of the things which they do believe, as will be prevalent against all that Force and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice wherewith they may be assaulted, and such as will not suffer their own Minds to be indifferent, careless or negligent about them. But whence should this arise? Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from outward <hi>natural</hi> Sense in <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> things we are not capable of; nor are they evidenced unto our Minds by Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Demonstration. All the full Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion or Assurance we can have of them, which will be prevalent against Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Oppositions, ariseth from such a <hi>spiritual</hi> View of them as gives an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their Reality, Power and Efficacy upon our Minds. And this respects both the Renovation of the Mind it self in Light and Faith, the Adhesion of the Will unto the things known and believed, with an holy, heavenly, unconquerable Love, and the constant Approbation of the good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:204232:127"/> and perfect Will of God in all things. Hence this Assurance, though it be neither that of Sense, nor that of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yet in the Scripture is compared with them, and preferred above them, as that which giveth the Mind a more certain Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction than they can doe, although it be of another kind. And without this it is impossible that men should attain any such Evidence or full Perswasion of that <hi>Evangelical Truth</hi> which they may profess, as to secure them in their Profession in such a Juncture of Circumstances and Occasions as they may fall into.</p>
               <p>Here therefore I place another Means and Cause of <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the Truth of the Gospel, after it hath been received and professed. Multitudes in all Ages have been instructed in the Truth; some have been learned and knowing in the Doctrines of it. But whereas by reason of their <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> as being destitute of <hi>spiritual Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> they did not discern the things themselves which they assented unto, in their supernatural, heavenly Nature and Glory, and thereon had no Experience of their proper Power and Efficacy on their own Minds, Affections, and Lives, they could not have any such Evidence of their
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:204232:128"/> Truth, as would upon Trials confirm their Adherence unto them, or secure them from <hi>Apostasie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had the Minds of men been <hi>transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in their <hi>Renovation</hi> to <hi>prove what is the good, acceptable and perfect Will of God;</hi> had they by <hi>beholding of Spiritual things been changed into the same Image from Glory to Glory by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> they would not have abandoned the most important Doctrines of the Gospel, as we know them to have done, nor have embraced foolish Imaginations in their stead, on every plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Courtship and Address unto their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. How came men under the <hi>Papal Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> gradually to desert the principal Truths of the Gospel, and all the <hi>spiritual</hi> Glory of its Worship? Not discerning the internal Glory and Beauty of things Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical and purely Divine, not having an Experience of the <hi>power</hi> of them in and upon their own Minds, they chose to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with and give Admission unto such things whose outward painted Beauty they could discern, and whose Effects on their natural and carnal Affections they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of.</p>
               <p>We have seen in all Ages, that men <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>skilled</hi> in the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Truth
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:204232:128"/> so as that they might have been looked on as <hi>Pillars</hi> of it, yet to have been as forward as any unto Apostasie from it, when they have been tryed; yea such have been the Leaders of others thereinto. So many of this sort fell into <hi>Arianisme</hi> and <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> of Old, as some have done unto <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,</hi> and many unto <hi>Popery</hi> in our dayes. When such fall away, usually they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Faith of some, and shake the Confidence of others. But the Apostle gives a double Relief against this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: First, the <hi>stability</hi> of Gods <hi>Purpose</hi> in the Preservation of the Elect, and the <hi>means</hi> of Preservation in the <hi>Holiness</hi> of them that Believe; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17, 18, 19. And we may be assured concerning them all, that they never had that <hi>intuition</hi> into, nor Comprehension of <hi>spiritual</hi> things which alone could secure their <hi>stability.</hi> They never saw so much or that in them for which they should be preferred above all other things. No man who forsakes the Truth ever saw the Glory of it, or had Experience of its Power. <hi>They went out from us, but were not of us,</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of such Persons) <hi>for if they had been of us,</hi> (whose Fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ) <hi>they would</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:204232:129"/>
                  <hi>no doubt have continued with us, but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>Thus when the Apostle had described the wofull Apostasie of some among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he addes concerning them whose Preservation he believed; <hi>But Beloved we are perswaded better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation; Heb.</hi> 6. 9. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Knowledge men may have of the Doctrines of the Gospel, and whatever Profession they may make, unless they have withall those things which are <hi>inseparable from Salvation,</hi> such as is the saving <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of the Holy Ghost, whereby the Darkness of our Minds is removed, there can be no Assurance that they will alwayes quit themselves like Men, and <hi>stand fast in the Faith.</hi> And this Consideration doth not a little evidence the danger of a Defection from the Truth which attends the dayes wherein we live.</p>
               <p>For first, It is from hence that we have such a numerous Generation of <hi>Scepticks</hi> in Religion, among us. A sort of men who pretend not to renounce or forsake the Truth, onely they will talk and dispute about it with the greatest Indifferency as to what is true or false. The <hi>Scripture,</hi> the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:204232:129"/>
                  <hi>holy Trinity,</hi> the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> his <hi>Offices,</hi> the Nature of <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be or be not, this or that Church, all or any in the World as to their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> are weighed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed tottering Scales of bold irreverend Discourses. For some Reasons known to themselves this sort of Persons will own the publick Profession of Religion, perhaps be Teachers in it. But on all Occasions they fully manifest that they are utterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the fundamental Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Truth and Error, and so give no firm assent unto what they do Profess. For this Difference lyeth in their Glory and Beauty in themselves, and in their Power and Efficacy towards us. Spiritual hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Truth,</hi> by its Relation unto the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Infinite Wisdome, Goodness, Love and Grace of God, by the Characters of all these things impressed on it and represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, is glorious, amiable, and desireable. All Errour, as an Effect of Darkness, and by its Relation unto Sathan as the Head of the Apostasie which drew off our Minds from the Original Essential Truth, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storted, deformed, and brings the Mind into Confusion. <hi>Truth</hi> is powerfull, and effectual to conform the Soul unto God,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:204232:130"/> and to principle it with a Love of, and Power unto Obedience. Error turns the Mind aside into crooked and by-paths of Folly or Superstition, or Pride and Self-advancement. Were men Practically ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this Difference between Truth and Error, it would take away that Indifferency in their Minds unto them, which this <hi>Sceptical</hi> humour doth disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Truth so known in its Nature and Efficacy will beget that Reverence, that Love, that sacred Esteem of it self in the Souls of men, as they shall not dare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute it to be bandied up and down with every foolish Imagination. And from this sort of men, who are commonly the most bold and forward in undertaking the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of others, by a pretended generous Contempt of their narrow Principles, groundless Scruples, and pusillanimous Fears, nothing is to be expected but a wise and safe Complyance with any Wayes or Means of Apostasie from the Truth which shall be advantageously presented unto them.</p>
               <p>And by the Means of this Darkness, it is easie to conceive how uncertain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable the Minds of the Generality of men, who perhaps also are somewhat ignorant
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:204232:130"/> (whereof we shall treat afterwards) must needs be in their <hi>Assent</hi> unto the Truth and the Profession of it. They are no way able to discover it in such a way or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to give them an Assurance which will be infallibly victorious against Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and Oppositions. Nor can they have that holy Love unto it, which will secure their Minds and Affections from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enticed and ravished from it. But all the difference between Truth and Error which they can discern, lying in bare diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Notions and Apprehensions, wherein also they are dark and unskilled, it is no wonder if at any time they make an easie Transcursion from one to the other. So did the Body of the People lose the Truth gradually under the <hi>Papal Defection</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great complaint, yea with much Complacency and Satisfaction. And it is to be feared, that multitudes are ready at once to steer the same course if Occasion be offered unto them.</p>
               <p>From this consideration we may rectifie the seeming <hi>Soloecisme</hi> that is in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion, or the Professors of it. <hi>Truth</hi> in every kind is the onely Guide of the Minde in all its Actings. Wherein it proceeds not according unto it, it is always
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:204232:131"/> out of the way. Divine Truth is the sole Conduct of the Mind in all its Actings towards God. It is the onely Fountain, immediate Cause and Rule of all our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But yet whereas in other things men generally walk in the Light of those sparks of Truth which they have received, we see that many by whom <hi>Divine Truth</hi> is owned and professed in its greatest Purity and highest Discovery, are oft-times no less wicked and vicious in their Lives, no less Enemies unto Holiness, no less barren and unfruitfull in those good and usefull Works it guides and directs unto, than those who having the greatest Aversation from it, are under the Conduct of other Principles Erroneous and Superstitious. Thus the Lives of the common sort of <hi>Protestants</hi> are no better than those of the <hi>Papists;</hi> nor theirs to be compared with some of the <hi>Mahumetans;</hi> yea by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of false and superstitious Apprehensions imposed on their Minds and Consciences, some are carried out unto greater and more frequent Acts of Bounty and Charity, of the Mortification of the Flesh, the denyal of its sensual Appetites and Satisfactions, than are to be found among the most who profess themselves to be under the Conduct
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:204232:131"/> and Rule of Truth. Hence no Profession of Religion, be it never so corrupt or foolish, is advanced amongst us, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, (at least for a season, and whilest it is New) it pretends an Advantage as unto Life and Conversation against the <hi>Truth</hi> measured by the Lives of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Professors. Yea this is made the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Motive and Argument to prevail with honest and well-meaning People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Compiyance with the Profession of their Way, because of the Effects which (as it is pretended) it produceth in their Lives and Conversations, above those which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the Truth. And how prevalent this Pretence hath been among us, is known unto all.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, I say, we cannot allow that the Lives of the <hi>common sort</hi> of Professors, should be esteemed a just and due Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they doe profess. It is true, that where it is not so, men will have no Benefit by their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor will they be stedfast in it when a Trial shall befall them. Where the Mind is internally and really conformed unto the Truth, there the Actions of the Life may be allowed to represent <hi>sincerely</hi> though not <hi>perfectly</hi> the Truths which are Believed.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:204232:132"/> And he is no firm Christian in any kind, he is brought into no spiritual Order, whose Mind doth not receive by the Spirit of Christ the transforming Influence of Evangelical Truth, and who exerts not the power of it in an holy Conversation, so as that he is not unwilling that what he <hi>believeth,</hi> may be impartially judged by what he <hi>liveth,</hi> as to Sincerity though not as to Perfection. But if we should allow the Lives of men in General to be a Rule whereby Judgement might be safely passed in these things, it cannot be denyed but that sometimes and in some Ages and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Error</hi> would (at least for a season) carry it in Glory and Reputation from the <hi>Truth,</hi> yea the Light of <hi>Nature</hi> from <hi>Grace, Tradition</hi> from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> from the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we have sufficient ground of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions unto this Interpretation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Doctrine of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and that without the least Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the ungodly Lives of its Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. Among these, that now insisted on is of the first Rank and Evidence. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of those who profess the Truth never had a View of its <hi>spiritual</hi> Glory, because of the Darkness of their Minds, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:204232:132"/> have no Experience of its Power and Efficacy, nor are their Hearts and Lives influenced or guided by it. For the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel will not have its Effects on the Minds of men, unless it first communicates unto them those internal spiritual Principles which are necessary unto all the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that it doth require. Put this New Wine into Old Bottles, and all is lost, both Bottles and Wine also. The Doctrine of the Gospel taken in Notionally into the old unrenewed corrupt Minds of men, is utterly lost unto all the proper Ends of it. And wherever there is a Reformation of Life, with any diligent attendance unto Duties Moral or Religious wrought in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by the Light and Dispensation of the Gospel, they are the <hi>immediate Effects</hi> of those Doctrines which it hath in common with the Light of Nature and the Law in its Power, and not of those which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly its own. And this they seem to to understand well enough, who finding either in their own Experience, or from the Observation they have made of others, how ineffectual the Truth of Gospel My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries is towards the Minds of carnal men, have upon the matter abandoned the Preaching of it, and have taken up onely
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:204232:133"/> with those Principles which are suited unto the Light of Nature and Convictions of the Law.</p>
               <p>The Holiness which the Gospel requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, is the transforming of our whole Souls into the Image and Likeness of God, with the Actings of renewed Nature in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <hi>Approbation</hi> of his good, perfect and acceptable will; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. But this will not be effected unless we can <hi>behold the Glory of God in it,</hi> whereby alone we may be <hi>changed into the same Image from glory to glory;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Nor can we so behold that Glory, unless he who commanded <hi>Light to shine out of Darkness,</hi> do shine into our Hearts to give us the Knowledge of it; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. Hence is the Doctrine of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual in the Hearts and upon the Lives of many by whom its Truth is openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.</p>
               <p>It is otherwise with every <hi>false Religion.</hi> The Motives which they make use of, and the Instruments they apply unto the Hearts of men to effect the Reformation of their Lives, and to engage them unto such Works and Duties as they require, are all of them suited either unto their Natural Light, or unto their Superstitions, Fears, Desires, Pride, and other depraved Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:204232:133"/> Those of the first sort, namely, such as are suited unto <hi>Natural Light,</hi> are common in some degree or measure unto all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whatever, be it on other Accounts true or false. Every thing that is called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> pretends at least unto the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Natural Light,</hi> as did the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> among the Heathen of Old. It urgeth also the Law so far as it is made known unto them, though by other Presumptions and Prejudices some do abate and take off from its Force and Efficacy, making void the Commandments of God through their own Traditions. Whatever change is wrought or effected on the Minds and Lives of men, by vertue of these Principles, and Motives taken from them, doth not belong unto any one way in Religion more than another; Nor is it to be accounted unto the Glory or Advantage of any of them. In these things <hi>Mahometisme</hi> and all false wayes in <hi>Christianity</hi> have an equal share and interest; unless where by some corrupt Opinions of their own, men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave the Light of Nature, and the Rule of the Law it self.</p>
               <p>Some finding, as they say, more of Justice, Temperance, Veracity, Righteousness in dealings, with common usefulness unto
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:204232:134"/> Mankind, among <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Banians</hi> than among the common sort of Christians, do foolishly begin to think, that their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is better than Christianity. But as this <hi>Scandal</hi> will be sorely required at the hands of them who give it by their flagitious Lives, so it is foolishly and wickedly taken by others. For those Truths and Laws which produce these Effects in them, are common unto all Religions, and are equally suited unto the Light and Reason of all Mankind; and have more Evidence and Efficacy communicated unto them by the <hi>Gospel,</hi> than by any other kind of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatever. And so it is with them among our selves who would plead an Advantage unto their Profession by the Effects of it in their Lives as to a Moral Conversation, when they can pretend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no real Motive thereunto, namely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what is good and usefull, and not meer Affectation and Hypocrisie, but what is owned and pressed in the Doctrine of the Gospel which we adhere unto. The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences therefore that are in this kind, are not from the Doctrines men profess, but they arise from the Persons themselves who embrace them, with their various Lusts, Inolinations and Temptations.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:204232:134"/>
               <p> It is evident therefore that whatever there is of Moral Good, Duty, or usefulness among men in any <hi>false Way of Religion,</hi> it all proceeds from those Principles, and is the Effect of those Motives which are own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and improved in that which is <hi>true.</hi> And it may be easily evinced, that they are more cultivated and cleared, have more Evidence, Life, Light and Power given them by the Truths of the Gospel, than by any other Means or Way whatever. And where they have not an <hi>equal</hi> Effect upon those who profess that Truth, which they have on some by whom it is deserted, it is from the Power of their own cursed Lusts and carnal Security. The Difference on the part of <hi>Religion</hi> it self consists in what is superadded unto these general Principles by any Notions of it. Now this in every false Religion is what is suited unto the Natural Principles of mens Minds, their innate Pride, Vanity, Curiosity, Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, irregular Hopes and Fears. Such among the <hi>Romanists</hi> are the Doctrines of <hi>Merit,</hi> of outward <hi>Disciplines,</hi> of <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions for sin,</hi> of <hi>Confession, Penances,</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and the like. They were all of them found out to put some <hi>awe</hi> on the Minds and to have some <hi>influence</hi> on the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:204232:135"/> Lives of Men, who had lost all <hi>sence</hi> of the Principles and Motives of Gospel Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; though some considerable respect was had unto the Benefit and Advantage of them by whom they were invented; for why should men labour and beat their Brains meerly for others, without some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and Revenue of Advantage unto themselves? And it is no wonder if they produce in many, as they have done, great appearing Acts of Devotion, many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward works of Bounty and Charity, yea in some, real Austerities of Life and Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations of the Pleasures of the world. I doubt not but that the sensual wicked <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi> of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> doth effectually prevail in the Minds of many of his Followers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that kind of Vertuous and devout Life which they suppose may bring them unto its Enjoyment.</p>
               <p>The Enquiry then on the whole matter is, Wherefore the <hi>Truths of the Gospel</hi> do not produce (in all by whom they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed) Effects as much more excellent than those mentioned, as Truth is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than Error, heavenly Light than Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, Faith than frightfull Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of saigned Torments, true Peace and Tranquility of Mind than outward Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:204232:135"/> and Glory? And the principal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereof is, because such Persons as are <hi>barren in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> do not discern those Truths in their spiritual Nature, nor can therefore take in the Power and Efficacy of them on their Souls.</p>
               <p>There is an <hi>Holiness,</hi> Obedience, and Fruitfulness in good Works, wrought, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and maintained by the <hi>Truth of the Gospel</hi> in them who are truely regenerated and sanctified thereby, who receive the proper Efficacy of it on their Minds and Souls, which differs <hi>in the whole Kind</hi> and Nature from any thing which the Principles and Motives before mentioned which have their Efficacy from their suitableness unto the depraved Affections of mens Minds, can produce. And this alone is acceptable with God; But it must be granted, that where men are <hi>Ignorant</hi> of the Power, and unacquainted with the internal Efficacy of the Gospel, their Lives under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Truth may be as bad, and it is a great wonder they are not worse than those of the <hi>Papists,</hi> of the most Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Persons, or even of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> themselves. For they have many super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Imaginations and false Principles,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:204232:136"/> that are suited to put some outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint upon their Lusts, and to press them unto Actions praise-worthy in themselves. But these being no way <hi>influenced</hi> by such Apprehensions, and being not under the Power of Gospel Truth, it is a wonder (I say) if they exceed them not in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wicked Conversation. It is not merely the <hi>outward Profession</hi> of the Truth, but the <hi>inward Power</hi> of it, that is either usefull unto the World or the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>And hence it is that the Preaching of any Person, which principally dwelleth on, and argueth from the things which the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> can of it self reach unto, and the Convictions which are by the <hi>Law,</hi> is better accepted with and appears more usefull unto <hi>multitudes of common Professors,</hi> than the Declaration of the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Gospel is. For such things are suited unto the <hi>Natural Conceptions</hi> of men, and the working of their own Reasons, which gives them a sence of what Efficacy they have; but being in the Dark unto the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Gospel, they neither see their Excellency, nor experience their Power. Nevertheless <hi>they</hi> and <hi>they onely</hi> are the true Spring, Cause, and Rule of all
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:204232:136"/> acceptable Obedience, even <hi>the Power of God unto Salvation in them that do believe.</hi> From the whole it appears how prone such Persons must be unto an Apostasie from the Truth, who have no spiritual <hi>Light</hi> to discern its Glory, nor to let in the Power of it upon their Souls.</p>
               <p>If then we would be <hi>established in the Truth,</hi> if we would stand fast in the Faith, if we would be preserved from the danger of that Defection from the Gospel which the World is prone, disposed and enclined unto, it must be our principal Endeavour to have a spiritual Acquaintance with the things themselves that are declared in the Doctrine of Truth which we do profess, and to have an Experience of their Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon our own Souls. Mere <hi>Notions of Truth,</hi> or the Knowledge of the Doctrines of it, enabling us to talk of them, or dispute for them, will not preserve us. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this spiritual Light be the <hi>Grace</hi> Promise and Gift of God, yet is it that which we are to endeavour after in a way of <hi>Duty.</hi> And the Directions ensuing may contribute somewhat towards the right discharge of our Duty herein.</p>

What we <hi>learn of our selves</hi> in spiritual Things, we receive onely in the outward Form of it; what we are taught by the Spirit of God we receive in its <hi>Power.</hi> The Apostle grants that the <hi>Spirit of Man,</hi> his Mind, Reason and Understanding is able to conceive of and apprehend the <hi>things of Man,</hi> things merely Natural, Civil or Moral, which are cognate unto Humane Nature: But, saith he, <hi>the things of God,</hi> the Mystery of his Wisdom, Love and Grace in Christ Jesus, <hi>are known onley unto the Spirit of God,</hi> and by him are they revealed unto them that do Believe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11, 12. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his especial Aid men may by their Natural Sagacity and Industry attain an Acquaintance with the Doctrines of Truth, so as to handle them (like the <hi>School-men)</hi> with incredible Subtilty and Curiosity: But they may be far enough, for all that, from an establishing Knowledge of <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things.</hi> That horrible Neglect which

The least spark of <hi>saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> in-laid in the Minds of the poorest Believers by the gracious Operations of the Holy Ghost, will be more effectual unto their own Sanctification, and more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent against Oppositions, than the <hi>highest Notions</hi> or most subtile Reasonings that men have attained in <hi>leaning unto their own understanding.</hi> Wherefore the Scripture abounds in Examples, Instances and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Prayer unto this End, that we may have the Assistances of the Holy Spirit in Learning of the Truth of the Mysteries of the Gospel, without which we cannot doe so in a due Manner. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Making mention of you in my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, in the Knowledge of him: The eyes of your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing being enlightened, that ye may know</hi>

When men learn that they may know, and are satisfied with what they know, without an endeavour to find the Life and Power of what they know in their own Hearts, their Knowledge is of little Use,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:204232:139"/> and their Assent unto the Truth will have no Stability accompanying of it. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate End (with respect unto us) of the whole Revelation of the Mind and Will of God in the Scripture, is, that it may put forth a <hi>spiritual practical Power</hi> in our Souls, and that we may doe the things which are so revealed unto us. Where this is neglected, where men content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a bare Speculation of Spiritual Truths, they doe what lyes in them to frustrate the End, and <hi>reject the Counsel of God</hi> in them. If therefore we would know any <hi>Evangelical Truths</hi> in a due manner, if we would have that Evidence and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them in our Minds which may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our Profession against Temptations and Oppositions, let us not rest in any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of Truth whose Efficacy we have <hi>no Experience</hi> of in our Hearts, nor think that we know any more of the Mysteries of the Gospel than we find ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually working in the <hi>Renovation</hi> of our Minds, and the <hi>transforming</hi> of our Souls into the Image of the Glory of God in Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Learn to esteem more of a <hi>little Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> which discovers it self in its <hi>Effects</hi> to be <hi>sanctifying</hi> and <hi>saving,</hi> than of the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:204232:139"/> highest Attainments in Notions and Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, though gilded and set off by the Reputation of Skill, Subtility, Eloquence, Wit and Learning, which do not evidence themselves by a-like Operations. We are fallen into dayes wherein men of all sorts, Sects and Partyes are <hi>vying for the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Skill,</hi> Ability, Knowledge, Subti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Cunning in Disputes about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And few there are who are cast un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such Disadvantages by apparent want of Learning, but that they hope to make it up one way or other, so as to think as well of their own Knowledge and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as of other mens. He who hath learned to be meek, humble, lowly, patient, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying, holy, zealous, peaceable, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his Heart, and to be Usefull in his Life, is indeed the Person who is best acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Evangelical Truth. Wherefore let this Knowledge be esteemed both in our selves and others above all that proud, presumptuous, notional, puffing Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which sets up for so great a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the World, and we shall have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of a blessed Success in our pursuit of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be not satisfied without a <hi>Discovery</hi> of such a Goodness, Excellency and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:204232:140"/> in <hi>spiritual things</hi> as may attract your Hearts unto them, and cause you to cleave unto them with unconquerable Love and Delight. This is that necessary, insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Adjunct, Property, Fruit or Effect of Faith, without which it is not Essentially differenced from the <hi>Faith of Devils.</hi> That Knowledge, that Perception and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Truth, which doth not present the things known, believed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as <hi>lovely, excellent</hi> and <hi>desireable</hi> unto the Will and Affections, is <hi>a Cloud without Water,</hi> which every wind of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation will scatter and blow away. Do not therefore suppose that you have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing of God in Christ, of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of his Grace, of his acceptable and perfect Will; unless you see therein that Evidence of Infinite Wisdome, Goodness, Holiness, Love, in all things so suited unto the Eternal Glory of God, and Advantage of your own Souls in the uttermost Rest, Peace and Satisfaction that they are capable of, as that you may admire, adore, delight in them and cleave unto them with an holy, prevalent, unconquerable Love. When you doe so, then will you be established in the Truth, and be able to bid Defiance unto the Artifices of Sathan with the <hi>Solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:204232:140"/> of men, that would withdraw or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate you from it. But I will not farther digress in these Discourses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ignorance</hi> is another Occasion of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie from the Truth, which was named under this Head of the <hi>Depravation of the Minds of men.</hi> It is the want of a due Perception, Understanding or Knowledge of the principal Doctrines of the Gospel, with the Evidence which is given unto them, and the use of them in the Scriptures, that we intend hereby. A general Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of some Doctrines without an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with their Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, their Use and Effects in the Life of God, is of no value in these things. When persons know not in Religion what <hi>they ought to know, as they ought to know it,</hi> or what it is their Duty to know, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Knowledge whereof they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form no other Duty of Religion in a right manner, then are they culpably <hi>ignorant,</hi> and so as to be exposed unto all other Evils that may befall them. For whether this be for want of <hi>due Instruction</hi> from others, or want of <hi>Diligence</hi> in themselves to Learn, the Event is equally pernicious. In the first way the Holy Ghost assures us, That <hi>where there is no Vision the People perish;</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:204232:141"/>
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 18 The People will suffer where those whose Duty it is so to doe, are not able to instruct them; For if the Blind lead the Blind, both must into the Ditch. And in general it is affirmed, That the <hi>People are destroyed for lack of Knowledge; Hos.</hi> 4. 6. Of such ruinous consequence by one means or other is the <hi>Peoples Ignorance</hi> of what it is their Duty to know. And by no one way doth it so effectually operate unto their Destruction, as by this of disposing them to a <hi>Defection from the Truth</hi> which they have professed, when any Trial or Temptation doth befall them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Multitudes,</hi> yea whole Nations are often brought unto an outward general Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Truth of Religion, especially with respect unto the Opposition of any other that is made thereunto. The Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Example of some that are in Power and Esteem among them, falling in with a season of encouraging Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, may produce this Effect, where men have little Knowledge of what they profess, and less Sense of its Power and Efficacy. So the Body of the People of Old turned unto the Profession of the true Religion under the <hi>Reformation</hi> made by <hi>Josiah; Nevertheless,</hi> (as the Prophet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,)
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:204232:141"/>
                  <hi>they did it not with their whole Hearts, but feignedly; Jer.</hi> 3. 10. They did it not out of Love to the Truth, or a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Respect unto the wayes of God, but in an <hi>hypocritical complyance</hi> with their Ruler. The Conversion of the <hi>Northern</hi> Nations after they had possessed the <hi>Western</hi> parts of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> was a Pledge of what their future Profession was like to prove. The first Conversion of the World, was by the laborious Preaching of <hi>Apostles, Evangelists,</hi> and others, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with many miraculous Operations, exemplified in Holiness of Life, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under all sorts of Persecutions. And by this Means none were received or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Profession of <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> but such as were Personally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of its <hi>Truth,</hi> instructed in its <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> conformed in their Lives to its <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> and engaged unto its <hi>Profession</hi> against Persecution. But in these latter Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions some Kings, Rulers or Potentates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dealt withall by <hi>Popes</hi> or other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and thereon (perhaps with no small Influence from Secular Considerations) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position unto <hi>Paganisme,</hi> their <hi>Allyes, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> usually followed them
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:204232:142"/> therein, having indeed little more of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity than the Administration of some external Rites, and a Relinquishment of their Old Idols for the New Saints pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto them. By this Means their first Profession of <hi>Christianity</hi> was laid in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Ignorance of the Principles and most important Doctrines and Duties of the Gospel. Hence it became most easie for them who were looked on as their Guides, to lead them into all those <hi>foolish Opinions,</hi> Idolatrous Practices, superstitious Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and blind Subjection to themselves, whence at length issued the fatal <hi>Apostasie.</hi> Knowing but little of what they ought to have known, and delighting not in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto what they did know, they willingly embraced themselves, and God Judicially gave them up unto those strong Delusions which turned them wholly from the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Thus the Generality of this Nation hath received and professed the <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> in opposition unto <hi>Popery.</hi> And no doubt many did so through a sincere and effectual Conviction of its <hi>Truth</hi> upon the first <hi>Reformation.</hi> But it is so come to pass, that what through their own supine Negligence and Carelesness about all things
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:204232:142"/> Invisible and Eternal, what through the Sloth, Ignorance, Laziness, and wretched Indifferency in Religion of some of those that should instruct them, Multitudes are become shamefully ignorant of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments and Principles of that Religion which they account themselves to profess. So hath it been almost in all Ages and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, after Profession became Notional. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will not make use of the Means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction which they have, and more want that Means in an effectual measure. Nor (it may be) can there be an Instance given where there hath been <hi>sufficient care taken,</hi> or at least <hi>sufficient Provision made</hi> for the Instruction of the Body of the People in all parts of it. Neither is that ordinary Course of the Ministry which is passant in the World, sufficient to this purpose. Can any man who knows any thing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, or of the Nature of men with respect unto <hi>spiritual things,</hi> once suppose, that the Reading of Prayers unto a People, or the Rehearsing of a Sermon without Zeal, Life, Power, or Evidence of Compassion for the Souls of men, accompanyed with a light, vain, worldly Conversation, (as it is with many) should answer the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal pattern of <hi>laying the Foundation,</hi> and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:204232:143"/> then <hi>carrying on of men</hi> by continual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction <hi>unto Perfection?</hi> From hence (as also from other Reasons obvious unto all impartial Observers,) it is, that Darkness covers the Earth and thick Darkness the People, ignorance prevailing on all sorts of men. Some will not learn, some have none to teach them, some are engaged in the pursuit of sensual Lusts and Vanities, some swallowed up in the Love of, and cares about the things of the world, few in any Age have been conscienciously diligent in the things which are of Eternal Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto them.</p>
               <p>This was that which facilitated the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Apostasie,</hi> from whence it took its rise, and by which it received its Progress. Those who would on the Motives men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned be accounted Christians, and which it was the interest of the pretended Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Religion to have so esteemed, being profoundly ignorant, they first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated the Practices of Religion unto their carnal superstitious Minds, and then gradually lead them into all Errours and Fables. For they were blind and knew not whither they went. So were the important Truths of the Gospel abandoned for <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Dreams,</hi> for Legends of foolish lying
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:204232:143"/> Miracles, and other Heathenish Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It was by Ignorance (I say) principally that the People gave themselves up unto the power of Seducers, which enabled the <hi>Architects</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Apostasie to carry them into Opinions, wayes and practices suited unto their secular Interest. And so sensible have they been of their Advantage hereby, as that some of them have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Ignorance</hi> as the most usefull Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the people in Religion.</p>
               <p>We may therefore well fix this as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cause or occasion at least of Apostasie; When men are ignorant of the Religion which themselves profess, as to its Doctrines and the principal grounds of them; where they are like the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not their own Religious Worship which they had received by Tradition, <hi>but worshipped they knew not what; Joh.</hi> 4. 22. They are no way able to defend themselves against the least Impressions of Seducers. They may plod on in the old Track of some formal outward Duties, but if any one meets them in their way, it is easie for him to turn them out of it. So the Apostle shewing the danger that Professors were in because of <hi>Apostatical Seducers,</hi> he assigns the Means of their Preservation to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:204232:144"/> be <hi>the Ʋnction which they had received, whereby they knew all things; Joh.</hi> 2. 19, 20, 27. Had they not been taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Truth, they could not at such a season have persevered in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Faith. Yea such Persons are very ready to think that there is <hi>something worthy their consideration</hi> in what is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto them by the most corrupt Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whereas they have really found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in what themselves have so long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. For no man can find any real Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, Profit or Advantage in that whereof he is <hi>ignorant.</hi> So it is said, that some by <hi>good words and fair speeches do deceive the hearts of the simple, Rom.</hi> 16. 18. Every thing they say hath a plausible Pretence and Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance unto Persons under that <hi>Character,</hi> so as that they are apt to be taken and pleased with it. Hence is that advice of the Apostle unto them who design Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment in Faith and Order. <hi>Brethren, be not Children in understanding; howbeit in malice be ye Children, but in understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be ye men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; be ye <hi>compleat, perfect,</hi> well instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your Minds, fully initiated into the Doctrines of the Gospel. Such the Apostle calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>perfect men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:204232:144"/> 5. 14. Those who in opposition hereunto are <hi>Children,</hi> that is, weak and ignorant, will also be uncertain and unstable. They will be as Children <hi>tossed to and fro, carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they lye in wait to deceive; Ephes.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p>For let some crafty <hi>Papal</hi> Emissaries come among this sort of People, and let them confidently tell them, that they neither have nor ever will have any <hi>Benefit</hi> by the <hi>Religion</hi> they profess; and that they have no Evidence or Assurance of the Truth of it; they tell them no more but what they will know to be true, if once they take it into consideration. For whereas they have seemed to be <hi>alwayes learning,</hi> by resorting to Church and the like outward Means whereby Religion is expressed, yet they never <hi>came to the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> Wherefore, when by any means they are put unto a stand, and are forced to consider themselves, they are amazed to find how little it is that they believe of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they profess, or know of the ground of what they would be thought to believe.</p>
               <p>Let such Persons adde, (as they will not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:204232:145"/> fail to doe,) that with them of <hi>Rome</hi> is full <hi>Assurance,</hi> that none ever mistook the way who accompanyed them that are of the Old Religion which their Forefathers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed so many Ages before this <hi>New-fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gledness</hi> came up, which hath filled all things with Confusion, Disorder, Sects, and Divisions; whereas before, all were of <hi>one Mind</hi> (which was the most plausible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paganisme</hi> against Christianity,) every troublesome personal Circumstance of their present condition, makes them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to believe, that it <hi>may be</hi> as they say. Let them tell them moreover of the Power granted unto the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of their Church to pardon all sorts of Sins, of the effectual <hi>Intercession</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and Angels, among whom they may choose out parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Patrons and Guardians for themselves; of the Mercy, Grace, Goodness, Power and Interest in Heaven of the <hi>blessed Virgin,</hi> all continually exercised in the behalf of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> of the <hi>Miracles</hi> that are daily wrought among them, of the wondrous <hi>Sanctity</hi> and Devotion which some among them have attained, they begin to think that there is somewhat in these things which they can <hi>feel</hi> or see, whereas in their own Religion they can understand
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:204232:145"/> little or nothing at all. The <hi>great things</hi> of the Gospel are <hi>strange things</hi> unto them; they neither doe nor can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them by all the diligence they think meet to use in this Case. But the things now proposed unto them have the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Tales,</hi> which the Mind of Man is accustomed unto, and apt both to receive and retain. And it is not imaginable how easie a <hi>Transition</hi> will prove, from a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whereof men know little or nothing at all, unto that which at one view pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents unto their Fancies and Senses all that they need believe or doe, that they may be eternally happy.</p>
               <p>Suppose one of another sort come among such persons, and at once call them off from the Profession of that <hi>Religion</hi> which they pretend unto, confidently requiring them to attend wholly <hi>unto a Light within them,</hi> which will be their Guide and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them unto God. They find by <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Experience</hi> that there is some such Light within them, as that which he seems to propose unto them; for there is so in all men, as the Apostle declares, even the <hi>Light of Conscience accusing or excusing as unto Sin or Duty; Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. Having therefore by reason of their <hi>Ignorance</hi> no
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:204232:146"/> Experience of any Power or Efficacy in that Religion which themselves profess, they begin to think there is a Reality in what is proposed unto them, and so are easily inveigled. For there is no security of his <hi>constancy</hi> for one moment when a Trial or Temptation shall befall him, who hath not Light or Knowledge enough of the Truth to give him some inward Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Efficacy of what he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess.</p>
               <p>But it is no way necessary to insist any longer on that which is so evident both in Matter of fact and in the Reasons of it. An <hi>Apostasie</hi> from a <hi>Traditional Profession,</hi> of those Truths which indeed men understand not, is easie, and in a time of Temptation unavoidable. In all Ages multitudes have thus perished for want of Knowledge. For such persons are destitute of defence against any <hi>external Cause</hi> or Means of Defection. They have nothing in their Minds to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to <hi>force,</hi> nothing unto Seductions or <hi>fraud,</hi> nothing to the <hi>Examples</hi> of great Leaders, nothing to conflict with the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi> of their own Minds, and will therefore when Wind and Tide suits the Design, comply with any fair pretence for a Revolt.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:204232:146"/>
               <p> And herein lyeth no small part of the danger of the publick Profession of the Protestant Religion among us. By whose defect principally God knows, but it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible how <hi>stupidly ignorant</hi> Multitudes are. Such there are who know no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Religion, whilest the <hi>same Names</hi> of God and Christ are commonly used, and same places frequented for Worship. Yet will this sort of men shew great zeal and earnestness against <hi>Popery</hi> and other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies. None more forward to revile, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and prosecute them to their power, as ready as <hi>Mahometans</hi> are to persecute <hi>Christians,</hi> or <hi>Papists</hi> sincere Believers, and that on the same Grounds. But if at any time they are put unto a stand, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to give an Account unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Reason of their own Religion, <hi>what</hi> it is they Believe, and <hi>why</hi> they do so, their Confidence will fail them, and like unto men fallen into <hi>Cross-paths</hi> and wayes, they will not know what to doe. And on such Occasions they are the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest of all men in a kind of <hi>Shame of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> to give up the Religion which they have professed, for any other wherein it is promised they shall have more Skill, and by which they may have some Benefit, as
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:204232:147"/> it is pretended, whereas by their own they have had none at all.</p>
               <p>Whatever therefore is amongst us or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where an occasion of <hi>Ignorance</hi> among the People, it doth expose them unto a fatal Defection from the Truth. If those upon whom it is incumbent to instruct them in the Knowledge of the Truths and Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gospel, are unskilfull or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the discharge of their Duty, they doe what lyeth in them to give them up bound hand and foot to the Power of their spiritual Adversaries. And they will be found chargeable with no less guilt, who lay Obstructions in the way of others who would willingly labour in the Instruction of them unto their power. A man would think from all Circumstances, and all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of the present Inclinations of the Minds of men, that it were the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of all that really love the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> to preserve its Professors from Apostasie, or any disposition thereunto. That this will be done effectually without a continual <hi>Instruction</hi> of them in the Truths which are to be professed, with their Grounds, Reasons and Effects, is so fond an Imagination, as that it deserves no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration; It is but to build Castles in the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:204232:147"/> Air, to suppose that men will be kept <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in the Profession of Religion,</hi> by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Laws, the Observance of external Forms, and the Secular Advantages of some Persons by it, wherein they are not concerned. They will not be so, I say, when a <hi>Trial</hi> shall befall them. There is no other Means that is appointed of God, or is rational in it self, for the attaining of this End, but that those who are so concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do what in them lyes <hi>personally</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the People in the Truth, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of them unto Obedience by their own <hi>Example,</hi> and to prevail with them who have the same design, to be assisting with them therein. But to cry out of the great <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion in the growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> and at the same time not onely to be Negligent themselves in the great Duty of communicating the real effectual Knowledge of it unto the Souls of men, but also to lay needless Obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the wayes of others who would sincerely endeavour so to doe, is an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable <hi>Soloecisme</hi> in Religion. Either we are not in earnest in our pretended <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Truth, and our Fears of the prevalency of <hi>Popery,</hi> or we believe not that Instruction in the Truth is the onely
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:204232:148"/> Means to preserve men in the usefull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it, which is to renounce the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and all rational Consideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall; or we are influenced by other things which we far more esteem than <hi>Evangelical</hi> Truth and the Purity of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principally in the Deliverance of the people from Darkness and Ignorance. And if through our <hi>Neglect</hi> they should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced again into the same State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they would be a ready Prey for the <hi>Papacy</hi> to seize upon. The Advice of the Apostle as to the Duty of all Gospel Ministers and Officers, in such a Season as we are fallen into, is that alone which will preserve us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>But it may be supposed, that so <hi>much Labour</hi> and Diligence in the Instruction and Teaching of the People, as some assert, is altogether unnecessary. It is enough if they be taught what are the <hi>general Principles of Religion,</hi> and do thereon comply with the Conduct of the Church whereunto they do belong. Besides, if this <hi>burden</hi> be incumbent on the Ministry, that those call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto are to have no Relaxation from constant sedulous <hi>Labouring in the</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:204232:148"/>
                  <hi>Word and Doctrine,</hi> and are moreover re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to exemplifie what they teach in the whole course of their Conversation, who would ever take upon him that Office that can advantage himself in the World any other way? It must needs prove very burdensome, if we have a <hi>Religion</hi> that will not be preserved in the Minds of men, without all this constant endless Toyl and Labour. In the <hi>Roman</hi> Church we see how easie a thing it is to keep up the People unto its Profession, whilest the <hi>Clergy</hi> are at Liberty to pursue and use the Pleasures and Honours of this World; nor are any of them obliged unto those irksome and endless Pains which we seem to require. Yea they find by Experience that <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in the <hi>People</hi> is the best Expedient to keep them in Subjection to the <hi>Priests,</hi> and then all things are secure. I wish that such thoughts as these do not influence the Minds of some unto a Readiness for a <hi>Change,</hi> if so be it might be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazard. But if more Pains, Diligence, Labour, with Perseverance therein, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by us in the <hi>Ministers of the Gospel</hi> and <hi>Guides of the Church,</hi> than the Holy Ghost in the Scripture doth plainly, posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, frequently enjoyn, let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:204232:149"/> and despised. Alas! the best of us, of all that are alive, do come short in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of the Rules and Examples that are proposed unto us therein. Nor doe I know on what <hi>Grounds,</hi> or by what Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures the most of us do intend to give up our Accounts at the last day. Nor is there any more impious Opinion nor more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the Gospel, than that it is enough for the People to be instructed onely in the <hi>general Principles</hi> of Religion, without any farther Improvement or Growth in Knowledge. For those who are thus called the <hi>People,</hi> are (I suppose) esteemed <hi>Christians,</hi> that is, Disciples of Jesus Christ and Members of his Mystical Body. And if they are so, their <hi>Growth</hi> in Understanding, their Edification in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, their being <hi>carryed on unto Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> their Acquaintance with the whole Counsel of God, with the Mysteries of his Love and Grace in Christ Jesus, are as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for them as the <hi>saving of their Souls</hi> indispensibly depending thereon, can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. And if we will be <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> it will not be best for us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe unto our selves, our Rules and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Duty. It will be our Wisdom to accept of that Office on the terms limited
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:204232:149"/> by the Holy Ghost, or utterly to let it alone. And we must know, that the more exactly our Profession is suited unto the Gospel, the less mixture there is in it of any thing <hi>humane,</hi> the more difficult it is throughly to instruct men in the Knowledge of it. The Mind of man is far more apt and able to comprehend and retain <hi>Fables, Errors</hi> and <hi>Superstitions,</hi> than Evangelical Truths. The former are Natural unto it; against the latter it hath a Dislike and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity untill they are removed by Grace. Hence some will make a more appearing <hi>Proficiency</hi> in a false Religion in four or five dayes, than others will doe in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth almost in so many years. We may have well-grown <hi>Papists</hi> in a Months time that shall be expert in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of their Devotion; and there is another Profession that <hi>two or three dayes</hi> will bring men unto a Perfection in. But <hi>slow</hi> is the progress of most in learning the Truth and Mysteries of the Gospel. If pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Diligence and constant Sedulity be not used in their Instruction, they will be made a Prey unto the next Opportunity for a Defection from the Truth.</p>

               <p>THe innate <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity of the Minds of men,</hi> is another Means whereby they are disposed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto an <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the Profession of Evangelical Truth.

The Mind of Man is Naturally lifted up with high Thoughts in it self and of it self. That it is sufficient unto all the Ends of its Being, all the Duties of its Condition, without any especial Aid or Assistance from above, is the prevailing Principle whereby it is
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:204232:150"/> acted. Men do not onely by Nature say, <hi>With our Tongue we will prevail, our Lips are our own; Who is Lord over us? Psal.</hi> 12. 4. we have a Sovereignty over all our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Actions; but also that nothing is, or can, or ought to be required of us, but what we have <hi>Power</hi> in our selves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, comply withall and perform; this in all Ages of the Church under various forms and pretences hath been contended for. The true state of all Controversies about the <hi>Powers of Nature and Grace,</hi> is this; That on the one hand the Minds and Wills of men are asserted to be <hi>self-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> as to internal Abilities unto all Duties of Obedience necessary unto eternal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness; on the other, That we have <hi>no sufficiency</hi> of our selves, but that all our sufficiency is of God; See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 8. This Principle which sprung imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately out of that Pride, whereby aiming at an Enlargement of our self-sufficiency we utterly lost what we had, was never yet rooted out of the Minds of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of professed Christians.</p>
               <p>In all things the Mind of Man would be its own Measure, Guide and Rule, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually teeming with these two Evils:</p>
               <p n="1">(1) It exalts <hi>Imaginations</hi> of its own,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:204232:151"/> which it loves, applauds, dotes on and adheres unto. This is the Original of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi> this hath given Birth, Growth and Progress to Error. For God made <hi>Man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but they sought out many Inventions, Eccles.</hi> 7. 29. Seeking out and exalting <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi> of our own in things Spiritual and Religious, is the principal and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Consequent of our fall from that state of <hi>Ʋprightness</hi> wherein of God we were created.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) It makes <hi>it self</hi> the sole and <hi>absolute Judge</hi> of what is Divinely proposed unto it, whether it be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false, good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> to be received or rejected, without Desire or Expectation of any <hi>supernatural Guidance</hi> or Assistance. And whatever is unsuited unto its own prejudicate Imaginations, it is ready to scorn and despise. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which we are now to demonstrate, is, That where this <hi>Pride</hi> and Principle are predominant, where the one is not <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> by Grace, nor the other <hi>eradicated</hi> by Spiritual Light, there men can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Truths of the Gospel in a due Manner, and are ready to renounce them when they have by any Means been brought unto the Profession of them for a season. For,</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:204232:151"/>
               <p> The Gospel, that is, the Doctrines of it, and Truths contained in it, is proposed unto us <hi>in the Name</hi> and on the <hi>Authority</hi> of God, having his Image and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription upon it. It hath such Impressions of Divine Wisdom, Goodness, Grace, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and Power upon it, as manifests it to be the <hi>glorious Gospel of the blessed God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. Hence it ought to be received with an holy Reverence, with a due sense of the Glory of God, and as his <hi>Voyce speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto us from Heaven.</hi> Hence is the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostle, that we would not <hi>refuse</hi> or turn from <hi>him who speaketh from Heaven, Heb.</hi> 12. 25. Without this it will never be duely received, truely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, nor steadfastly believed. It is not to be received as <hi>the Word of Men, but as it is in Truth the Word of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 13. It must be received with that Frame of Spirit, with that Submission, that Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Soul and Conscience, which becomes poor Worms of the Earth when they have to doe with the great and holy God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 27. So our Saviour tells us, that <hi>unless we be converted and become as little Children, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Unless we deny our selves and all our own Imaginations, unless
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:204232:152"/> we become <hi>humble</hi> and teachable, we can never arrive at an usefull Acquaintance with the Mysteries of it. And he convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the learned <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that by reason of their Pride, Vain-glory and Hypocrisie, they could not perceive or understand the Doctrine which he taught.</p>
               <p>God promiseth that he will <hi>teach the Meek</hi> or Humble <hi>in Judgement;</hi> the <hi>Meek will he teach his way,</hi> Psal. 25. 9. <hi>The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will shew them his Covenant,</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>Whom shall he teach Knowledge? whom shall he make to understand Doctrine? Them that are weaned from the Milk, and drawn from the Breasts,</hi> Isa. 28. 9. Unless Men become as weaned Children, as <hi>David</hi> affirms of himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> 131. 2. when <hi>his Heart was not haughty nor his Eyes lifted up,</hi> Ver. 1. God will not teach them. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no such effectual Obstruction of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Teachings as the <hi>Pride</hi> of mens Minds, which is utterly inconsistent with them. Hence it is that Men come with carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in themselves, the Ability and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeity</hi> of their own Minds, to the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Gospel and the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, without the least peculiar Awe or Reverence of God from whom it is. And
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:204232:152"/> hence do they suppose themselves without more adoe, <hi>competent Judges</hi> of the Mind of the Holy Ghost in all Divine Revelations. Can men who have once read the Scripture imagine that this is the way to <hi>learn Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Truth,</hi> or to partake of the Teachings of God? Will the same Frame of spirit suffice them in this Design, as that which they have when they are exercised about their other Occasions? When we consider how men for the most part <hi>learn the Truth,</hi> we need not wonder to see how easily they <hi>unlearn</hi> and forsake it. If the Truth at any time be entertained by a Soul whose Mind is <hi>unhumbled,</hi> and whose Affections are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified, it is a troublesome Inmate, and will on the first Occasion be parted withall. It is true, we ought to imploy the utmost of our Rational Abilities in the Investiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacred Truth: But yet if therein we follow the Conduct of our own Minds, diving perhaps into Subtilities and Niceties, forsaking an humble dependance on the Teachings of God, it may be under Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of singular Wisdom, we betray our selves into ruinous Folly. This was that which corrupted all the Endeavours of the <hi>School-men,</hi> and left them in the height of their Enquiries to <hi>wax vain in</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:204232:153"/>
                  <hi>their Imaginations.</hi> The way of handling <hi>spiritual things</hi> in a <hi>spiritual Manner,</hi> in the <hi>Words</hi> which the <hi>Holy Ghost teacheth;</hi> that is, not with curious subtle Reasonings and Inventions of carnal unsanctified Minds, but with that Evidence and plainness in Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, suited practically to affect the Minds and Consciences of men, which the Scripture giveth us both Example and Rule for, was despised by them. But they came to the study of Sacred Things with their Minds stuffed and prepossessed with Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical Notions and Conceptions, with Sophisms, Distinctions, and various Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the <hi>Serpentine</hi> Wits of men, which they mixed with <hi>Divinity,</hi> or the Doctrine of the Scripture, wofully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, debasing and perverting it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Most of their Disputes were such as had never had Foundation nor Occasion in the world, if <hi>Aristotle</hi> had not invented some odde Terms and Distinctions remote from the common Understanding and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of men wiser than himself. To enquire into <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> with an holy, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Frame of Heart, waiting and praying for Divine Teaching and Illumination of Mind, that themselves might be <hi>made wise</hi> in the Knowledge of the Mysteries of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:204232:153"/> Gospel, and able to instruct others in the Knowledge and Fear of God, it never came into their Minde. But being furnished and <hi>puffed up</hi> with a Conceit of their own <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity,</hi> Philosophical Ability, and disputing Faculty, harnassed with <hi>Syllogismes, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, Solutions,</hi> and most preposterous Methods of Craft; they came with Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness on Christian Religion, and forming it to their own Imaginations, dressing it up and exposing of it in foolish terms of Art, under a semblance of <hi>wondrous Subtility,</hi> they wholly corrupted it, and drew off the Minds of men from the <hi>Simplicity of the Truth</hi> as it is in <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> Not one <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> of Religion did this proud self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Generation of men leave, that (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Conclusions were true or false about it,) any man could come to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of it, who had not been a better Proficient in the School of <hi>Aristotle</hi> than of Christ. To Believe and Teach the Doctrine of the Scripture, though with <hi>sound Reason</hi> and Judgement, and in the way of the Scripture to affect the Minds and Consciences of men without their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Notions, Niceties, Distinctions, whereby they had carved a corrupt, depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, monstrous Image of all things, and the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:204232:154"/> Knowledge of them, was among them to be an Heretick or a Block-head. By the Pride, Confidence, and pretended Subtilty of these men, was <hi>Religion</hi> totally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and the <hi>Fountains</hi> poysoned from whence others sought for the <hi>Waters</hi> of the Sanctuary. Even what was left of <hi>Truth</hi> among them was so debased, so devested of its native heavenly Glory, Beauty and Majesty, was rendred so deformed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited unto that <hi>spiritual</hi> Light wherein alone it can be usefully discerned, as to render it altogether useless and inefficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto its proper Ends. Nor are we ever in more danger to subduct our selves from under the <hi>Teachings of God,</hi> than when we lean unto our own Understandings in our Enquiries into <hi>spiritual</hi> things, so as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that <hi>humble lowly frame of Heart</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alone we are meet to be Taught, or to Learn in a due manner. And this is one way whereby men through the <hi>innate Pride</hi> of their Minds are obstructed in the Receiving, and disposed unto the <hi>Relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of Evangelical Truths.</p>
               <p>Again; It is confessed that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing proposed unto us in the Gospel that is <hi>contrary</hi> unto Reason, as Reason is the due Comprehension and Measure of things
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:204232:154"/> as they are their own Nature. For how should there be so, seeing it is in it self the principal external Effect of the Reason or <hi>Wisdom of God,</hi> which hath given unto all things their Natures, Properties and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures? But yet there are things revealed in it which are <hi>above the Comprehension of Reason,</hi> as planted in the finite limited Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Man. Nor is the Ground hereof the <hi>accidental</hi> Corruption of our Nature, but the <hi>essential</hi> Constitution of its Being. There are (I say) Divine Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Gospel whose <hi>Revelation</hi> we may understand, but the <hi>Nature</hi> of the things themselves we cannot comprehend. And this Reason it self cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For whereas it knows it self to be finite, limited and bounded, how should it be able perfectly to comprehend things Infinite, or all the Effects of Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Can we by searching find out God? can we find out the Almighty unto Perfection? It is high as Heaven, what can we doe? deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Hell, what can we know? the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broader than the Sea; Job</hi> 11. 7, 8, 9. These things so exceed the natural and duely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate Objects of our Understandings, as that we cannot find them out to <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:204232:155"/> The Reason of Man hath nothing here to doe, but humbly to comply with the <hi>Revelations</hi> that are made of them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there are in the Gospel Things that are unsuited, yea <hi>contradictory</hi> unto Reason as it is Corrupted. Reason in us is now no longer to be considered merely as it is <hi>finite</hi> and Limited, but as in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> and Exercise of it, it is impaired, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and corrupted. To deny this, is to deny the fundamental Principle and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that in all things the Gospel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth on; that is, That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> came into the World to restore and repair our Natures. In this state as it is unable of it self to <hi>discern</hi> and judge of <hi>spiritual Things</hi> in a due manner, so it is apt to frame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it self <hi>vain Imaginations,</hi> and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed with innumerable <hi>Prejudices,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto what the Gospel doth teach and require. And whatever it doth so fancy or frame, the Mind esteems as proper Acts and Effects of Reason as any it exerciseth or is capable of.</p>
               <p>With respect unto both these, namely, the <hi>Weakness of Reason</hi> as it is Finite and Limited, and the <hi>Depravation of Reason</hi> as it is Corrupted, it is the Design of the Gospel to bring every thought into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:204232:155"/> unto the Obedience of Faith. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the former it requires men to Believe things <hi>above their Reason,</hi> merely on the Authority of Divine Revelation. Things they must believe, <hi>which Eye hath not seen,</hi> nor <hi>Ear heard,</hi> neither have they <hi>entred into the Heart of man to conceive,</hi> onely they are <hi>revealed unto us by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. It will not admit of an Enquiry <hi>how</hi> those things may be which the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken. The Sence and Meaning of the <hi>Revelation</hi> it may enquire into, but cannot comprehend the things Revealed. <hi>Nobis Curiositate opus non est post Jesum Christum, nec Inquisitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne post Evangelium; cum credimus nihil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideramus ultra credere, hoc enim priùs cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus, non esse quod ultra credere debemus. Tertull. Praescrip. adv. Haeres.</hi> And when of Old, the Wise, the Scribes, the Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this World, would not submit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, under the supposed conduct of their Reason, they fell into the most brutish Unreasonableness, in Judging the <hi>Wisdom of God</hi> to be <hi>Folly,</hi> and his <hi>Power</hi> to be <hi>Weaknesse,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25. And it is an unparallel'd Attempt of <hi>Atheism</hi> which some in our dayes (who would yet
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:204232:156"/> be accounted Christians) have engaged in: They would exalt <hi>Philosophy</hi> or <hi>humane Reason</hi> into a Right of <hi>Judicature</hi> over all <hi>Divine Revelations.</hi> Nothing must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be contained in them, but what is measurable by <hi>its</hi> Principles and Rules. What pretends to be above them they say it ought to be rejected, which is to make it self <hi>Infinite,</hi> or the Wisdom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of God <hi>Finite</hi> and Limited. Wherefore, as to the things that are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Gospel, because many of them are absolutely <hi>above</hi> the Comprehensions of our Minds or Reasons, they are not the <hi>Judge</hi> of them, but are the Servants of Faith onely in bearing witness unto them. <hi>For the things of a Man knoweth the spirit of a Man that is in him, but the things of God knoweth no Man but the Spirit of God;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11, 12. In brief, To affirm that we can be obliged to <hi>believe no more</hi> than we can comprehend, or nothing but what we can perfectly understand the Nature of in it self, or that we may reject what is really <hi>above Reason,</hi> on a Supposition that it is <hi>contrary</hi> unto Reason, is to renounce the Gospel, and therewith all Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Revelations. And this is spoken not of Reason as it is <hi>corrupted,</hi> but merely as
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:204232:156"/> it is Humane Reason, <hi>Finite</hi> and Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As in things <hi>infinite, spiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi> the Gospel proposeth unto men things quite <hi>above</hi> their <hi>comprehension,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing their Reason to be <hi>pure</hi> and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, onely allowing it to be that which is <hi>finite</hi> and limited; so in thigns which Practically respect the Obedience of Faith which it doth require, it prescribeth things <hi>contrary</hi> unto our natural Conceptions, or Reason as it is in us <hi>depraved.</hi> For the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conceptions of our Minds about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duties and the way of Living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, are all of them suited unto the <hi>Covenant of Works:</hi> For they are the Effects of the Remainders of that Light which did direct us to walk with God thereby. But hereunto the Disposal of things in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace</hi> is <hi>diametrically</hi> opposed, so that their Accounts will never intermixe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. Yea the <hi>carnal Mind,</hi> that is, Reason as it is corrupted, acts its Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction unto the Will of God as revealed in the Gospel with <hi>Enmity</hi> and Hatred; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. And for those Duties which are suited unto the Light of Nature, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel doth so <hi>change</hi> them with the Respect it gives them unto the Mediation of Christ
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:204232:157"/> and the Efficiency of the Holy Spirit, as that corrupted Reason defies them being so qualified, as foreign unto its Conceptions. The Duties themselves it can approve of, but not of their <hi>Respect</hi> unto Jesus Christ, whereunto they are disposed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that of Old those who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended such an <hi>absolute Sovereignty</hi> in their own Reason, as to admit of nothing as Truth but what its Dictates complyed withall, were of all men the slowest to <hi>receive,</hi> and the forwardest to <hi>oppose</hi> the Mysteries of the Gospel; Because they were <hi>above</hi> it in some things, and <hi>contrary</hi> unto it in more, as it is in most things corrupted, they looked on them as <hi>folly</hi> and so despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them. This the Apostle declares and records; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 1<seg rend="sup">st</seg>, 2<seg rend="sup">d.</seg> Especially was it so among them who unto the <hi>vain Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi> wherein in general their <hi>foolish heart was darkened,</hi> had superadded some peculiar Sect in <hi>Philosophy</hi> which was of Reputation among the Wise-men of the World. For they conceived and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the <hi>Maxims</hi> of their Sect as the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Dictates of Right Reason, though most of them were foolish Fancies, either taken up by <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>sophistically</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:204232:157"/> on their Understandings. Hence eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that was contrary unto such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or inconsistent with them, they looked on as opposite unto <hi>Reason,</hi> and so Despised it. Nor is it much otherwise at this day with many Christians, who make the <hi>Traditional Principles</hi> of their Sect or Party, the <hi>Rule</hi> whereby every thing that is in Religion proposed unto them, may be examined. Thus though the Generality of <hi>Philosophers</hi> and Wise-men at <hi>Athens</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Doctrine of the Apostle, yet were there none so forward and fierce in their Opposition unto him, so contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously proud in their Censures of him, as were the <hi>Epicuraeans</hi> and <hi>Stoicks, Act.</hi> 17. 18. And the Reason hereof was, because the Doctrine which he taught was eminently contrary to the <hi>Maxims</hi> of their peculiar Sects. For whereas the <hi>Epicuraeans</hi> denyed the <hi>Providence</hi> of God in the Government of the World, the <hi>Existence</hi> of the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men after this Life, all Eternal <hi>Rewards</hi> or <hi>Punishments,</hi> there was no Admission of any one word of the Apostles Doctrine without a Renunciation of all their impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sentiments, and so the Ruine of their Sect. And as for the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Principle of their <hi>Philosophy</hi> was,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:204232:158"/> That a Man should look for all Blessedness or Happiness in and from Himself alone, and from the things that were in his own Power, as being every way sufficient unto himself for that End. All that the Apostle taught concerning the <hi>Mediation of Christ</hi> and the <hi>Grace of God</hi> by Him, was also <hi>diametrically</hi> opposite unto this Principle. Wherefore, those of these two <hi>Sects</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him in a peculiar manner; not onely from the Pride and Darkness that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the Minds of men, and improved by the Advancement of corrupted Reason <hi>above</hi> its own proper Place and Dignity; but from the <hi>prejudicate Opinions</hi> which on the Reputation of their Sects they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered unto, as assured Dictates of right Reason in general. And when some such Persons as these, afterwards upon a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conviction of its Truth took upon them a Profession of the Gospel, they were the men who corrupted its principal My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries by their vain Philosophy, as the Apostle intimates, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. So <hi>Tertullian: Haereses à Philosophiâ subornantur. Inde Aeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; formae, &amp; nescio quae, &amp; Trinitas hominum apud Valentinum, Platonicus fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.

               </p>
               <p>We may apply these things unto our present purpose. The Design of the Gospel in all its especial Truths and Mysteries, is, to bring <hi>every Thought in Subjection unto the Obedience of Faith.</hi> Hence is that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection which Flesh and Blood will never comply withall; <hi>If any man among you seemeth to be Wise in this World, let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Fool that he may be Wise,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Unless Men renounce their carnal Wisdom in all its Principles, Effects and Operations, they will never become <hi>Wise</hi> with that Wisdom which is from above. And he who knoweth not what it is so to become a <hi>Fool,</hi> be he who he will, was never yet <hi>Wise</hi> towards God. Wherefore, when men have taken on them the <hi>outward Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> they begin to find upon Enquiry, that the Mysteries and Principles of its <hi>Doctrine</hi> are unsuited unto the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pride</hi> of their Minds, and inconsistent with that absolute <hi>Sovereignty</hi> which they would in all things give unto their own Reason. Hereon many <hi>Inventions are sought out</hi> to cast off the Yoke of <hi>Faith,</hi> and to re-inthrone <hi>Reason</hi> in the Room thereof.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:204232:159"/> Not that Men depart from the Faith with this express Design, but this is that which secretly influenceth them thereunto. Hence the Generality of those who forsake the <hi>Truth</hi> on this Ground and Occasion, are such as trusting <hi>too soon</hi> to their own <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Abilities,</hi> having neither Will, nor Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, nor Industry, to enquire into the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> in a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, do give up themselves unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Teaching of others, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Opinions more suited unto the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Pride</hi> of their Minds and <hi>carnal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings.</hi> And some by an over-earnest pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of the workings of their own Rational Faculties in <hi>spiritual things,</hi> having sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted their Minds from that <hi>humble Frame</hi> wherein alone they are capable of <hi>Divine Teaching,</hi> are betrayed into the same Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage. All ancient <hi>Heresies</hi> sprung from this Root; yea, those of them which are most absurd and foolish, and most <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically</hi> opposite unto right Reason, arose from a Pretence thereof. For when Men will have Reason to have an absolute <hi>Supremacy</hi> in Religion, it is unavoidable but they must judge that their <hi>own</hi> is the Reason which is intended; and that some may be led hereby into very foolish Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:204232:159"/> is easie to be conjectured, unless we shall suppose all men to be equally wise and sober.</p>
               <p>I shall briefly exemplifie these things in one Instance, and that in a prevalent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie from the Truth, and which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is visibly progressive in the World. This is that of <hi>Socinianisme.</hi> And I shall give an Instance herein, because the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it is highly Efficacious where it meers with the Complexion and Constitution of Mind before described, and is more diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed than many are aware of. For although the Name of it be generally condemned, and there are some Opinions comprized under it, whose Profession is inconsistent with the Interest of the most, yet all those <hi>Deviations</hi> from the Truth which we have amongst us under several Denominations, are Emanations from that corrupt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Yea the whole of it being <hi>a Systeme</hi> of Opinions craftily suited unto the first Notions and Conceptions of corrupted Reason, and the in-bred Pride of Mens Minds in them, who on any Account own <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> the first Proposal of them finds ready Entertaiment with many of those whose Souls are not prepared and fortified against them by a <hi>spiritual</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:204232:160"/> of the Excellency, Power, and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Mysteries of the Gospel. They no sooner hear of them but they know they express what they would <hi>have,</hi> as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying all the corrupt Desires and carnal Reasonings of their Minds.</p>
               <p>There are, as was observed before, two sorts of things in the Doctrines of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. (1) Such as are <hi>above</hi> the Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension and Measure of Reason in its best Condition, as it is in us <hi>Limited</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</hi> (2) Such as are <hi>contrary</hi> unto it as <hi>Corrupted</hi> and <hi>Depraved.</hi> And unto these two Heads is this kinde of <hi>Apostasie</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is <hi>above Reason,</hi> Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible by it, those of this way do absolutely reject. Such are the Doctrines of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and of the <hi>Incarnation of the Son of God.</hi> Because <hi>the Things</hi> taught in these Doctrines are not comprehensible by their Reason, they conclude that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant unto right Reason. And by others the same Doctrines are refused as not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant with the <hi>Light</hi> that is within them. For the <hi>Existence of the Divine Nature in Three distinct Persons,</hi> with the <hi>Hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ʋnion</hi> of the Natures of God and Man in the same Person, they cannot acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:204232:160"/> These things, so fully, so plainly, so frequently revealed and asserted in the Scripture, so attested by the Primitive <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> are rejected on no other Reason, but that they are <hi>against Reason;</hi> nor is there any pretence that they are so, but because they are <hi>above</hi> it. When they have puzled themselves with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his Question, <hi>How can these things be?</hi> they peremptorily deny their Existence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot comprehend the Manner of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As unto those things which are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto Reason as corrupted,</hi> these they deprave and wrest unto a complyance therewithall: So they deal with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Attributes of God,</hi> of his <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Decrees,</hi> of the <hi>Office and Mediation of Christ,</hi> of <hi>Justification</hi> by his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, of the <hi>Power and Efficacy of the Grace</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in the Conversion of Sinners, and of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the Dead. Because they cannot bring their Reason as corrupted and depraved unto a complyance with these Truths, rhey will force, hale, torture and rack the Truths themselves to bring them into <hi>slavery</hi> unto their own Reasons, or carnal fleshly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of <hi>spiritual</hi> things. For allowing
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:204232:161"/> the Words, Terms, and Propositions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are expressed, they put absurd sences upon them, destructive unto the Faith, and contrary to the whole Scope and Design of the Scripture; so do they endeavour expressely to bring every Divine Revelation into <hi>Captivity</hi> unto the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of their own perverse Reasonings and Imaginations.</p>
               <p>It is therefore evident that this kind of Apostasie springs from no other Root but the <hi>Pride of the Minds of Men,</hi> refusing to admit of Evangelical Truths on the meer Authority of Divine Revelation, where they are <hi>above Reason</hi> as it is <hi>limited,</hi> or <hi>contrary</hi> unto it as <hi>corrupted.</hi> On these terms the Gospel can no where keep its Station, nor will it foregoe its Prerogative by subjecting it self to be tryed by these uncertain Measures, or weighed in these uneven tottering Ballances. The <hi>humble,</hi> the <hi>meek,</hi> the <hi>teachable,</hi> those who are made free and willing to captivate their Understandings unto the Obedience of Faith, are those alone with whom it will abide and continue.</p>
               <p>But it may be said, that this being onely one private <hi>Heresie,</hi> of no great Extent or Acceptation in the World, there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:204232:161"/> of any influence from it into a more general Defection. So it may be, it seems unto many, but I must acknowledge my self to be otherwise minded; and that for two Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because of the Advance which it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth every day in the Addition of new, bold, proud <hi>Imaginations</hi> unto what it hath already made its successefull Attempts in. For in the pursuit of the same Principles with those of the men of this way and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, not a few begin absolutely <hi>to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Scripture</hi> and every thing contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it to the Judgement and Sentence of their own Reason, which is the true Form and Spirit of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> visibly act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self with some more than ordinary Confidence. What is suited unto their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they will receive, and what is not so, let it be affirmed an hundred times in the Scripture, they will reject with the same Ease and Confidence as if they were <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> of Men like themselves. Both <hi>Books</hi> that are written unto this purpose, and the common <hi>Discourses</hi> of many do fully testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unto this Advance of the <hi>Pride</hi> of the Minds of Men. And he is careless about these things who seeth not, that the next Stage is down-right <hi>Atheisme.</hi> This is that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:204232:162"/> Dunghill which such blazing Exhalations of Pride do at last fall into. And herein do many countenance themselves with a false and foolish Pretence, that all those whom they differ from are <hi>fanatical</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Reason, when they ascribe unto it all that any man in his Wits can so doe, who believeth Divine Revelations, and doth not absolutely disavow the <hi>corruption</hi> of the Nature by the Fall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Poyson</hi> of these Principles is greatly diffused in the World. For hence it is that all those Doctrines of the Gospel which have any thing of <hi>spiritual Mystery</hi> in them, which are constituent Principles of, or do any way belong unto the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace,</hi> and so not absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable unto Reason as Corrupt and Carnal, are by many so laden with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Scorn, that it is sufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any man unto the Contumelies of <hi>Ignorant, Irrational</hi> and <hi>Foolish,</hi> who dares to avow them. Such are the Doctrines of <hi>Eternal Predestination,</hi> of the <hi>total Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Nature of Man</hi> as unto Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things by the Fall, of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Efficacy of the Grace of God</hi> in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sinners, of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> of <hi>Ʋnion</hi> with Christ, of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:204232:162"/>
                  <hi>Justification</hi> by the Imputation of his <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> of the Nature of Internal Inherent Righteousness or <hi>Evangelical Holiness,</hi> of the Necessity of continual Supplies of the Spirit in <hi>actual Grace</hi> unto all Duties of Obedience, of the <hi>Power of the Holy Ghost</hi> evidencing the Divine Authority of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in and by themselves, with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry others. Many can see no <hi>Reason</hi> for the admittance of these things, or they cannot see the Reason of them; and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are fully and plainly declared in the Scriptures, yet are they (by no small Generation among us) so derided and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, as that the very Names of them are grown into Contempt. But why all this <hi>Scorn,</hi> all this Severity? Men may do well to consider, that not long since all the <hi>Prelates of England</hi> owned those Doctrines as <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> which now they so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride. And although they are not obliged by any Divine Precept to be of the same Judgement with them because it was <hi>theirs,</hi> yet it may be they are under some Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the <hi>Laws of the Land</hi> not to Renounce the Ancient Doctrines of the Church, and are certainly bound by the Laws of Christian Modesty and Sobriety, not to vilifie and scorn the Doctrines they
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:204232:163"/> owned, and all that do profess them.</p>
               <p>But it is Warrant sufficient unto some for the utmost Detestation of any Principles in Religion, that they have a seeming <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance</hi> with their <hi>Reason,</hi> though appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently corrupted by Prejudice, and weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Ignorance. Hence they will not admit that there can be a Consistency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Ʋnchangeableness</hi> of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and the <hi>Freedom</hi> of our Wills; That <hi>Justification</hi> by the Blood of Christ doth not render our own <hi>Obedience</hi> needless; That the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of Gods Grace and the <hi>Necessity</hi> of our Duty, are reconcileable. And herein they seem to take along with them as their Security these two Principles, seeing without them they have no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build upon.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) That <hi>Reason</hi> as it acts in them, is the same with <hi>right Reason</hi> in general, that whatever Respect is due to the one, is so to the other. It were well in the mean time, if Prejudices, corrupt Affections and gross Ignorance did not on great variety of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions manifest themselves among this sort of Persons; and not onely so, but such a course of Conversation among some of them, as none can think consistent with the <hi>Divine Teachings</hi> who Believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:204232:163"/> But it is so come to pass, that all that Humility, Meekness, Self-diffidence, all that Conscientious Fear of sinning and Practice of Holiness, which the Word of God makes so necessary unto them who would learn <hi>the Truth as it is in Jesus,</hi> are by many (puffed up with a Conceit of their own Ability to know all things) ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disregarded.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) That there is no Time nor Instance wherein those thoughts which seem to us most <hi>Rational,</hi> are to be captivated unto the Obedience of Faith. And yet without this there is no true Knowledge of the Mind of God in the Gospel to be attained. What such Principles will carry men out unto in Religion were easie to <hi>conjecture,</hi> if Experience did not render <hi>conjecture</hi> hopeless in this case.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, this Pride of the Minds of Men refusing to bow or subject themselves unto the <hi>Authority of Divine Revelation,</hi> designing to exalt Self in its <hi>Intellectual</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Abilities, in its Powers to know what it should, and do what it ought, hath in all Ages been a great Principle of Opposition unto, and Apostasie from <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> Truth. Nor was it ever more Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant than in the Dayes wherein we live.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:204232:164"/> For besides that it hath openly spawned that whole brood of Errors which some entire Sects do espouse, it diffuseth it self in its Effects among all sorts of Professors of Christianity. An <hi>humble subjection</hi> of Mind and Conscience unto the <hi>Authority</hi> of God in his Word, which alone upon trial will be found to answer the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Believers, is the onely security against this Distemper. This we may, this we ought to pray for, not onely for our selves, but that it might be given of God unto them who scarce Believe that God gives any thing that is <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> unto the Souls of men in any such way, as that the Effect should depend on the Efficiency of Grace, and not on their own Wills.</p>
               <p>Unto this <hi>Pride,</hi> as inseparable from it, we may adjoyn that <hi>Vanity and Curiosity</hi> that are in the Minds of men. These are those which the Apostle marketh under the outward Sign and Effect of them, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>itching Ears;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. For hence an Inclination and hearkening of Mind after things <hi>novel, vain</hi> and <hi>curious,</hi> doth arise. Under the power of those Affections men <hi>cannot endure sound Doctrine,</hi> nor will abide in the Simplicity of the Gospel. They
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:204232:164"/> know not how to be <hi>wise unto Sobriety,</hi> and to keep their Speculations about <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> things within the bounds of sober Modesty. But they are still <hi>intruding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> into things they have not seen, being <hi>vainly puffed up in their own fleshly Minds, Col.</hi> 2. 18. And as this <hi>Curiosity</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many of these needless vain Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, subtle, nice, philosophical Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Distinctions, wherewith some have filled Religion, so from the uncured <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of Mind doth proceed that Levity and Inconstancy which are in many, whereby they are <hi>tossed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine</hi> that blows upon them from the cunning Sleights of men who lye in wait to deceive. Unto all we may adde, that <hi>carnal Pride</hi> and Ambition (where the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affairs of the Church or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion are accompanyed with such Secular Advantages of Wealth, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Rule as to stirr up Envy and Emulation among men of Earthly Minds,) which as they have occasioned many scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Outrages in Religion, so they have been the Rise and Occasion of many <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies</hi> also.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Careless Security and groundless Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences</hi> do betray men into Apostasies from
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:204232:165"/> the Gospel, when unexpected Trials do befall them. To give Evidence hereunto we may do well to consider the things that ensue.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Holy Spirit hath sufficiently warned us all, that Defections and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings from the Truth would fall out among the Professors of it. This hath been already abundantly manifested in the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Instances</hi> of such <hi>Warnings</hi> and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions before produced and insisted on. And there is in the Word a vehement Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication made of all these Warnings unto us and our Duties. Thence are those <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> multiplyed, to <hi>Watch,</hi> to <hi>stand fast</hi> in <hi>the Faith,</hi> to <hi>be strong</hi> and <hi>quit our selves like men</hi> in this matter. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>Diligent Attendance unto all Gospel Duties, and a vigorous acting of all Gospel Graces,</hi> will preserve us, if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be believed. And as for those by whom these things are despised it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at all what Religion they are of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are foretold and forewarned of the great <hi>Danger</hi> that will attend the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the Gospel when such a <hi>season of Apostasie</hi> shall by any means come upon them. So prevalent shall the means of it be, as that <hi>many shall be deceived,</hi> and if it were
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:204232:165"/> possible <hi>even the Elect</hi> themselves; <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 10, 24. Such a Season is an <hi>hour of Temptation that cometh on the World to trye them that dwell upon the Earth, Rev.</hi> 3. 10. And the wofull Event in them that shall be overtaken with the Power of it, in their utter and eternal Destruction, is in many Instances set before us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is also plainly intimated, that <hi>such a season</hi> of the Prevalency of a Defection from the Truth shall be a time of <hi>Great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> among the Generality of professed Christians. Churches shall be asleep, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons shall cry <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> when that Day cometh as a snare.</p>
               <p>We are not therefore left without <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Warning</hi> in this Case, both of the <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of our Trial, the <hi>greatness</hi> of our Concernment, and the <hi>danger</hi> of Security. And yet notwithstanding all these Means of Excitation unto a <hi>vigorous Attendance</hi> unto our Condition, Danger and Duty, it is evident unto every discerning Eye, how desperately <hi>secure</hi> are the Generality of Professors of the Gospel with respect unto this Evil and the Consequents of it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can <hi>awake</hi> them unto the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own state, although their <hi>Neighbours houses</hi> are set on fire from Hell.
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:204232:166"/> Love of the World with Prosperity and Ease on the one hand, or the Cares and Businesses of it on the other, do so take up the Minds of men that they are not sensible of any Concernment in these things. And we may briefly consider the various wayes whereby this <hi>security</hi> puts forth its Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in disposing men unto Apostasie when they they shall fall into the Occasions of it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) It doth so by <hi>possessing</hi> and <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring</hi> them with a proud, careless, supine <hi>Negligence.</hi> Men hear of this Evil and the Danger of it, but (like <hi>Gallio)</hi> they <hi>care for none of these things.</hi> They know not of any Concernment they have in them, nor of any Need they have to provide against them. Unto some others perhaps these things may belong, but unto them not at all. Those who would press them on their Minds and Consciences, they look on as Persons causelesly importunate, or troubled with groundless Suspitions and Fears. If there be any <hi>danger about Religion,</hi> they doubt not but sooner or later Provision will be made against it by <hi>Law.</hi> But as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any especial Duty incumbent on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with respect unto their own Souls, they know nothing of it, nor will consider
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:204232:166"/> it. Had not the World been asleep in this <hi>security,</hi> had not men been utterly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of their Interest in the Truth, it had not been possible that Religion should have been so totally corrupted as it was in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and yet so few take any notice thereof. At some Seasons God raised up among them <hi>Witnesses of the Truth,</hi> who not only declared and professed it, but also sealed their Confession with their Blood. But the Generality of <hi>Christians</hi> were so far from being excited thereby to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of their own Concerns and Duty, as that they opposed and <hi>persecuted</hi> them unto Destruction, as the Disturbers of the <hi>publick Tranquillity.</hi> And it is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise at this Day. Many complain, more fear a Defection from the Gospel. It is also evident in how many things the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it is already by some <hi>corrupted,</hi> by whom it was formerly <hi>professed.</hi> Instances of as great Apostasies as the Name of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> is capable of, are multiplyed among us: And yet how few are there that do at all <hi>regard</hi> these things, or once consider what is either their Duty or their Danger in such a season!</p>
               <p n="2">(2) It worketh and is effectual by a <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Indifferency</hi> as unto all things in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:204232:167"/> Men under the Power of this <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> neither see nor will understand, nor can be made sensible of the difference that is between <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Error, Piety</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,</hi> so as to value one more than another. It is all <hi>Religion,</hi> and it is no more but so. If Persons change from <hi>one Way</hi> to another, so as they do not utterly renounce <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> they may be saved in the way they betake themselves unto. The Profession of such Persons attends on all Occasions, and an <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the Mysteries of the Gospel will be but an use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full complyance with Opportunity.</p>
               <p>We judge no Men, no Party of Men as to their Eternal State and Condition upon the account of their <hi>outward Profession</hi> in Religion, unless they are open <hi>Idolaters</hi> or <hi>flagitious</hi> in their Lives. God onely knows how it is between him and their Souls. The framing of Churches (as the <hi>Church of Rome,)</hi> according unto mens Minds, Fancies, Opinions or Interests, and then <hi>confining Salvation</hi> unto them, is an Effect of Pride and Folly, as contradictory to the Gospel as any thing that can be imagined. But yet there is a wide Difference to be made between <hi>Apostates</hi> and others. Better men had <hi>never known the way of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:204232:167"/>
                  <hi>than after they have known it, to turn aside from the holy Commandement.</hi> Those who have been instructed in the Truth of the Gospel and made Profession of it, are for the most part acted by such <hi>depraved Principles,</hi> moved by such <hi>corrupt Lusts,</hi> and do shew so much <hi>Ingratitude</hi> against the Lord Jesus Christ in their Defection, <hi>denying the Lord that bought them,</hi> that they put a peculiar Character and Mark upon themselves. And although we will not <hi>judge</hi> any, yet is it our Duty to put men in Remembrance of the Danger that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends such Apostasies. So the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that upon their admittance of <hi>Legal Ceremonies,</hi> and falling from the Grace of the Gospel in that one point of <hi>Justification,</hi> that <hi>Christ should profit them nothing,</hi> or they should have no Benefit by what they yet retained of the Profession of the Gospel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4, 5. And as to those who are carryed away by the strong Delusions of the grand Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie foretold, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. he sayes plainly, <hi>that they shall be damned, ver.</hi> 12. As <hi>Peter</hi> also affirms, that those who introduce <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Heresies do bring on themselves and those that follow their pernicious wayes, swift destruction;</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2. So little Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:204232:168"/> doth the Scripture give unto this Effect of cursed <hi>Security.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) It likewise worketh by <hi>vain Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</hi> Most men think with <hi>Peter,</hi> and on no better Grounds than he did, (nor so good nether, as not being conscious unto themselves of so much sincerity as he was,) that <hi>though all men should forsake</hi> the Truth and Purity of Religion, yet they will not do so. But they understand not at all what it is to be preserved in an Hour of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor what is required thereunto. They <hi>scorn</hi> to fall away, and yet they <hi>scorn all the Means</hi> whereby they may be preserved from so doing. Tell them that they stand in need of the <hi>Power of God</hi> for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, of the <hi>Intercession</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> of the <hi>constant Supplyes</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> of an <hi>Experience</hi> of the Goodness and Efficacy of the Truth, with the Benefits which their own Souls have received thereby, and that for this End they are to <hi>watch, pray,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> in a constant Attendance unto all Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Dutyes; and they despise them all through their <hi>Pride,</hi> or neglect them through their <hi>spiritual Sloth</hi> that they are given up unto. Such persons as these, if they meet with any thing that <hi>mates their Confidence,</hi> fall at once under the Power
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:204232:168"/> of the next Temptation they are assaulted withall. Wherefore, whereas the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of professed Christians are influenced one way or other by this <hi>wofull Security,</hi> it is no wonder if they are surprized and hurried away from their Profession by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,</hi> or that they will be easily carryed down the stream when they fall into a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Inclination unto a Defection.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Love of this present World and the perishing Satisfactions of it,</hi> betrayes innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Souls into frequent Apostasies from the Gospel. So the Apostle assures us in the Instance of <hi>Demas;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present World.</hi> And as he forsook the Apostle, so also the work of the <hi>Ministry,</hi> and it may be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> therewithall. I shall not insist on that <hi>Love of the World</hi> which works by <hi>Covetousness</hi> in the course of Mens Lives, though this be a Means also disposing them unto Apostasie. For our Saviour affirms, that the <hi>Seed which falls among Thorns is choaked;</hi> The Word which is received by Men whose Hearts are filled with the Cares of this present World never comes to the Perfection of Fruit-bearing. I shall onely make mention of <hi>two Seasons</hi> wherein the Predominancy of this Love in the Hearts
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:204232:169"/> of men, multiplies Apostates from the Truth.</p>
               <p>The first is that of <hi>Persecution,</hi> wherein the Professors compared by our Saviour unto the <hi>stony ground</hi> do presently fall away. Such persons, saith he, <hi>have no root in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> but <hi>during for a while, when Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Persecution ariseth because of the Word, they are offended; Matth.</hi> 13. 20, 21. The first thing that <hi>Persecution</hi> attacques the Minds of men withall is their <hi>secular Interests</hi> in this World; their Wealth, their Houses, Lands and Possessions are put into hazard by it. Willing it may be this sort of men are to <hi>follow</hi> Christ for a while with the <hi>Young Man in the Gospel;</hi> but when they hear that all they have will be hazarded, it may be must be parted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, they goe away <hi>sorrowfull.</hi> Sorry they are for a while to leave that Word or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which before they had received with <hi>Joy;</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 20. But sorrowfull as they are, Love of the World overcomes all other Considerations, and away they goe. What <hi>Multitudes</hi> such seasons have driven from the Truth; what Starrs they have cast down from the Heaven, no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath had greater Experience than our own in the dayes of <hi>Queen Mary;</hi> I pray
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:204232:169"/> God it never meet with another Trial, and also hope that it is not likely so to doe.</p>
               <p>The other Season where Love of the World gives up Men unto this <hi>fatal Evil,</hi> is, when and where <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> are Enthroned. We may look into some soreign Nations where the Gospel had once taken great place, especially a great part of the <hi>Nobles</hi> were Obedient unto the Faith. But the Supreme Power of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions abiding in the hands of those of the <hi>Roman Profession,</hi> and therewith the Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of Authority, Riches, and Honour, those vain Bubbles of the World, and Idols of corrupted Minds, it is known what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence it hath had upon the Profession of Religion; most of the Posterity of those great and truely Noble Persons which once professed the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion being in most places fallen back into the Old Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie. For their Minds being filled with the <hi>Love of this World,</hi> and precipitated by Ambition into a fierce pursuit of their Desires, finding the way to worldly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Wealth shut up unto all that would stedfastly adhere unto the Truth, they have generally sacrificed their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, Consciences and Souls unto this
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:204232:170"/> predominant Lust. And such a Season as this, is more to be feared than <hi>Persecution</hi> it self. Many have a generous Stoutness not to be violently forced out of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion and Profession. But when these cursed Baits are laid before men with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pretences to stifle their Consciences, and Advantages to keep up their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is no setting up a Damm against the Torrent of their <hi>Love of this World.</hi> The Warmth of the Sun caused him to <hi>cast away his Garment,</hi> which the Bluster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wind did but <hi>wrap closer about him.</hi> The Rayes of Power in Honours and Favours have made more cast away their Religion in the Neighbouring Nations, than Persecutors ever could doe. Whilest therefore the <hi>World</hi> is enthroned in the Minds of Men, whilest it is made their <hi>Idol,</hi> whilest Hopes of Advance, and Fears of Loss, are the principal Affections whereby their Course of Life is steered, Profession of the Truth stands upon very uncertain and ticklish terms. And therefore whilest we see that the Minds of Multitudes are under the Power of this <hi>Lust,</hi> all the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can be had of their continuance in the Profession of the Truth, is their not being lead into either of the Temptations men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:204232:170"/>
               <p> I shall not insist on other depraved Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Minds of Men. The Truth is, there is no one prevalent Lust, no one predominant Sin, no Spiritual or Moral Disorder indulged unto, but it disposeth the Soul first unto an <hi>under-valuation,</hi> and then a <hi>Relinquishment</hi> of the Truth, as Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions are offered.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>The hand of Sathan is in this matter.</hi> He was the Head of the first Apostasie from God. Having himself fallen away from that Place and Order in the <hi>Obediential</hi> part of the Creation wherein he was made, the first work he engaged in, (and he did it effectually,) was to <hi>draw Mankind</hi> into the Guilt of the same Crime and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ever since the Revelation of the Means of <hi>Recovery</hi> for Man, (from which he was justly excluded) he hath pursued the same design towards all unto whom that way of Recovery is proposed: Thus he quickly carryed away the <hi>whole Old World</hi> upon the matter into <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And ever since God hath been pleased to make known the way of Life and Salvation by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> his two great Designs and Works in the World have been, to keep men off from Receiving the Gospel, and to turn them aside who have Received it.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:204232:171"/> The first he managed two wayes; First by stirring up <hi>raging bloody Persecutions</hi> against them that professed it, to deterre others from engaging into the like way: And the other by <hi>Blinding the Eyes of Men,</hi> and fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Prejudices against the Truth; as the Apostle declares, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. By what Wayes and Means in particular he carryed on this first Design in both parts of it, belongs not unto our present En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. Failing herein, his principal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in the World hath been, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth yet to be, the <hi>corrupting</hi> of the Minds of men about the Truth, and drawing them off from it in part or in whole, so the Apostle intimated; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>I fear least by any means as the Serpent beguiled Eve by his Subtilty, so your Minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ.</hi> It was the <hi>Serpent</hi> by whom <hi>Eve</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled, but who is it the Apostle is jealous that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> might have their Minds corrupted by from the Simplicity that is in Christ; that is, by false Doctrine, or as it were <hi>another Gospel,</hi> as he speaks, <hi>ver.</hi> 4? It was the same <hi>Serpent</hi> by himself and in his <hi>Agents,</hi> as he expresseth it <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. And he compareth his Attempt to draw off Professors from the Gospel, unto his
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:204232:171"/> Attempt on <hi>Eve,</hi> whereby he began the Apostasie from God in the state of Nature. The Tenure of the Covenant was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto our first Parents in the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> and the <hi>Threatning</hi> annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto. And he beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> by Corrupting the <hi>Threatning</hi> by his false In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it, whereby he corrupted her Mind. The Tenure of the Covenant of Grace is proposed unto us principally in the <hi>Promises</hi> of the Gospel, which are the Center of the whole Doctrine of it. These therefore he endeavours by all Means to pervert, in Opposition unto the Wisdom and Grace of God in them. Hereby he hopes to draw off Men from the <hi>Simplicity that is in Christ,</hi> or the plain Declaration of the Will of God in the Gospel, unto false and foolish Imaginations of his own suggestion. And what an hand he was to have in the great <hi>Apostasie,</hi> the Apostle foretells; 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 9, 11. There was to be the <hi>working of Sathan</hi> in it, and <hi>strong</hi> or effectual <hi>Delusions unto the belief of Lyes,</hi> which are all from him who is the Father of them. So Men departed from the <hi>Faith</hi> by <hi>giving heed to seducing Spirits;</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. that is, the Devil and his Agents. It
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:204232:172"/> would be too long a Digression to engage into a particular Enquiry, How, by what Wayes and Means, Sathan prevails with men to turn them off from the Truth, and turn them unto Fables. How he blinds their Minds, how he enflames their Lusts, how he presents Occasions, how he sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests Temptations with false and corrupt Reasonings, what Colours and Pretences he puts upon his Designs when he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms himself <hi>into an Angel of Light,</hi> with what Power Signs and lying Wonders he gives Countenance to his Delusions, how he works on the Minds of <hi>Seducers,</hi> how on the Minds of them that are to be <hi>sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi> how he stirres up Persecution against the Truth and its Profession; would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Discourse <hi>fully</hi> to declare longer than the whole of this is designed to be. It may suffice to know, that he is not <hi>weary</hi> nor <hi>wanting</hi> unto any of those manifold Advantages which are administred unto him. He is at work in all places at this day, in some making Havock of the Churches, in others by various Wiles and Artifices filling the Minds of men with Prejudices against the Truth, and turning them from it.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>God</hi> doth not look on all these
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:204232:172"/> things as an <hi>unconcerned Spectator.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not <hi>tempted with Evil;</hi> He <hi>Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth none,</hi> he seduceth none, but he rules them all, and over-rules all Events unto his own Glory. He will not suffer men first to undervalue and despise, and then to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> and <hi>forsake</hi> the chiefest of his Mercies, such as his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> are, without reflecting on them with some Acts of his severity. Wherefore, when men from the corrupt Principles mentioned, seduced by the Lusts of their own Hearts, and entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled by the Deceits of Sathan, do relinquish the Truth; God in his holy righteous Judgement gives them up unto <hi>farther De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions,</hi> so that they shall compleat their Apostasie, and grow obstinate therein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Destruction. When a People, a Nation, a Church, or private Persons have received the Gospel and the Profession thereof, not walking answerably thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; God may forsake them, and withdraw from them the Means of their Edification and Preservation. The <hi>Rule</hi> of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance with any People or Church as to the outward Dispensation of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the Means of Grace, is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>The Lord is with ye while ye be with him, and if ye seek him he</hi>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:204232:173"/>
                  <hi>will be found of you, but if you forsake Him he will forsake You.</hi> He <hi>judicially</hi> forsakes them by whom he is <hi>wilfully</hi> forsaken.</p>
               <p>God may be forsaken by men in <hi>one</hi> way, and he may Righteously forsake them in <hi>another:</hi> For instance; Under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Truth men may give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto all <hi>Ʋngodliness</hi> and <hi>Ʋnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> unto a flagitious course of Life in all Abominations; so holding the Truth captive in Unrighteousness. In this Case God oft-times in a way of <hi>Punishment</hi> gives men up unto an Apostasie from the Truth which they have professed, to shew that he will not alwayes have it prostituted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lusts of men. So the Apostle speaks expressely; 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. Although <hi>they received the Truth</hi> in the Profession of it, yet they <hi>loved it not,</hi> they yielded not Obedience unto it, but <hi>took pleasure in Sin;</hi> therefore God ordered things so, that they should <hi>reject the Truth it self also,</hi> and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Lyes unto their own Destruction. Herein at this day lyes the danger of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and ruinous Apostasie. Multitudes, the Generality of all sorts, the Body of the People do yet assent unto and profess the Truth; But alas! what are the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Conversations</hi> of many under that Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:204232:173"/> How do all manner of Sins abound among us? The Profession of the Truth by <hi>not a few</hi> is the greatest Dishonour and Disparagement that can be cast upon it. The best Service many can doe it, is by <hi>forsaking</hi> it, and declaring that the Belief of it is inconsistent with their cursed wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Lives. And may we not justly fear, lest such persons should speedily be given up by one Means or other to <hi>strong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions</hi> to Believe a Lye unto their just Damnation. And on the other hand also, God sometimes gives men up to <hi>Sins and wickednesses in Practice,</hi> because of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Truth which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: So he dealt with them who liked not <hi>those Notions</hi> of Truth which they had concerning Him, his Being, and his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, from the Light of Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. And so he usually deals with all Apostates. If they <hi>will</hi> forsake the Truth, they <hi>shall</hi> forsake Righteousness and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which are the proper Fruits of it, and be given up unto all abominable Lusts and Practices.</p>
               <p>We may therefore enquire by what Wayes and Means God doth so punish and revenge the Beginnings of <hi>Wilful Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> from the Gospel, so that Men shall
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:204232:174"/> compleat them and prove obstinate in them, unto their Eternal Destruction. And this he doth,</p>
               <p>First, By <hi>removing his Candlestick</hi> from among them. This the Lord Jesus threatens his backsliding Church withall; <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. God will by one Means or another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of the Light and Means of the Knowledge of the Truth, that Ignorance and Darkness shall cover them, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistably encrease upon them. Some of the Instruments of Light it may be shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by Death, and some shall lye under Prejudices, the Gifts of the Spirit shall be restrained or with-held from others, that they shall have <hi>Darkness</hi> for <hi>Vision,</hi> and the <hi>Sword of the Lord shall be upon their right Eye that it shall be quite dryed up.</hi> In this Condition of things the Minds of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states already bent upon Backsliding, are by their Ignorance and Darkness more and more filled with Prejudices against the Truth, and alienated from it. For as they lose the Knowledge and Faith of any part of Truth, their Minds are possessed with what is opposite thereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly; In this Condition God <hi>sends them strong Delusions</hi> that they may <hi>believe a Lye;</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 11. God is, as it were,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:204232:174"/> now resolved on the End of these Persons, what they have righteously deserved. And therefore he makes use of any Means as it is meerly <hi>poenal</hi> to bring them thereunto. And as by the former Act of his Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure he took from them the Knowledge of his Truth, so by this he gives them up irrecoverably to adhere unto a Lye, they shall not onely <hi>profess</hi> it, but <hi>believe</hi> it, which is the cruellest Slavery the Mind of Man is capable of. Now Gods sending of men <hi>strong Delusions that they may believe a Lye,</hi> consists in these things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>Delivering</hi> them up to the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Sathan.</hi> He is the grand Seducer, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luder of the Souls of men, the first Author of Lying, whose principal Design it is to win over the Faith and Assent of men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. This work he stands continually ready for, but that God is pleased to <hi>limit, bound</hi> and <hi>restrain</hi> him with respect unto those who are yet under his especial Care; But as to these <hi>Apostates,</hi> God breaks down all his Fences about them, and by his efficacious Permission suffers Sathan to act his part to the utmost, for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion. This was the state of things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Papal Apostasie;</hi> wherein Sathan had deluded men, (as it should seem) to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:204232:175"/> the Satisfaction of his utmost Malice. And to shew how Absolute he was in his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, he did as it were <hi>make Sport</hi> with the deluded Souls of Men. There was nothing so <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>sottish</hi> that he did not impose on their Credulity. Many <hi>Volumes</hi> will not contain the Stories of those <hi>ridiculous Follies</hi> which he hath so imposed on the Minds of poor deluded Mortals, wherein he seemed to sport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the Misery of blinded Mankind. God grant that he never receive a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to act the same part among us, whose sins seem to cry aloud for it; and Men live as if they longed to be again given up to the Power of the Devil.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) By suffering <hi>Seducers</hi> and <hi>false Teachers</hi> to come among a People, with such advantagious outward Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as shall further their Success. These <hi>Seducers</hi> prepare themselves for their work by their own Inclinations and the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of Sathan. But God for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of his just Displeasure, will by his Providence put <hi>Advantages</hi> into their hands, of prevailing over the Minds of men. So the chief Seducers in the World at this day, namely, the <hi>Pope</hi> and those Acting with or under him, have possessed
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:204232:175"/> that Place, and obtained that <hi>Reputation</hi> among men, as gives them oft-times an uncontroulable Successe in their Work. Did men stand upon even Ground with them who were in the Profession of the Truth, should any so come unto them to perswade them unto the Errors, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions and Idolatry of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> they could not but despise their offer. But these Men having once gotten the Name of the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> and shewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the People in the stead and place of God, what could they not draw and <hi>seduce</hi> them unto? Neither is their Superstition or Profession continued on any other Grounds on the Minds of the Multitude, but onely by that <hi>Power</hi> over the Consciences of Men, which <hi>Names, Titles,</hi> and the Places they seem to possess in the Church, do give unto them. Then therefore doth God give up men to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, when in his Providence he affords such <hi>Advantages</hi> unto them by whom they are to be deluded. For those who pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the places of <hi>outward Veneration</hi> may lead a backsliding Multitude into what they please.</p>
               <p>Lastly, God doth <hi>judicially</hi> smite such Persons with <hi>Blindness of Mind</hi> and <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:204232:176"/>
                  <hi>of Heart,</hi> that they shall <hi>not see, nor perceive, nor understand,</hi> even when the Means of Light and Truth are proposed unto them. This Effect of Gods Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is declared; <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11; and Application is made of it unto the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Ministry of our <hi>Saviour</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 40, 41. and that of the <hi>Apostles; Act.</hi> 28. 29; and is expounded <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 8. When things are come to this Issue, when God <hi>subducts</hi> the Means of Grace from men in the <hi>whole</hi> or in <hi>part,</hi> or as unto their Efficacy, when he <hi>permits</hi> Sathan to deceive them by strong Delusions, and moreover himself <hi>smites</hi> them with Hardness of Heart and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mind, then is the State of such <hi>Apostates</hi> miserable and irrecoverable. We are not therefore to think strange, that the Light of the Gospel diffuses it self no more in the World, that so Eminent <hi>a stop</hi> is put unto its Progress; God hath put an End unto his Gracious dealings with some kinds of <hi>Apostates,</hi> and they are reserved for another Dispensation of his Providence.</p>
               <p>These are some of the general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that <hi>Defection</hi> which is in the World from the Mystery and Truth of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:204232:176"/> the Gospel, with the Reasons and Causes of them, unto which more (I doubt not) of the like Nature may be added.</p>
               <p>But there is moreover a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration to be had of those <hi>especial Truths</hi> which any turn away from, and the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations they fall into, whereof the espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grounds and Reasons, superadded unto these we have considered, as equally respecting every kind of Defection from the Gospel, are also to be enquired into, and it shall be done in <hi>one Instance</hi> among our selves.</p>

               <p>BEsides the Reasons insisted on, which have a general Influence into all <hi>Apostasies</hi> from the Doctrine or My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospel, each especial <hi>Defection</hi> in every kind, hath Reasons and Causes peculiarly suited unto its Rise and Furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. There are indeed not a few who forsake the Truth which they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, merely on the Impressions of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumstances, in the encouraging Examples of some who go before them in the same Paths, from whom they expect Advantage. And every Age giveth us in one place or another <hi>renewed Evidence,</hi> that where either <hi>secular</hi> Interest, or Weariness of the Truth, through the Love of the present World, and Hatred of Holiness, or strict Evangelical Obedience, do give a
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:204232:177"/> Propensity unto a Declension from any Doctrines of the Gospel, unto Persons whose <hi>Grandeur</hi> and outward Advantages are sufficient to attract a Complyance from the Minds of men under the Power of Ambition, or any importunate desire of Earthly things, that <hi>Multitudes</hi> of all sorts suppose there is nothing left for them but to croud who shall come nearest the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Apostasie. And it is not seldom that meeting with new Temptations they <hi>out-run</hi> both them and themselves also, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such Extreams as at first they designed not. For hence it is, that so many do even at present issue their Recessions from the Truth under the Conduct of those <hi>Ignes fatui</hi> or Erratick Exhalations of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Favour, in the undesigned Boggs of <hi>Popery</hi> on the one hand, or <hi>Socinianism</hi> on the other. But I shall not at present take them into further Consideration, nor indeed are they worthy of any at all, whose Minds are visibly byassed in the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi> with those that are <hi>earthy</hi> and <hi>carnal.</hi>

               <p>They are of another sort from whom we may take an Instance of the especial Reasons of a <hi>peculiar Defection</hi> from the Gospel. For it is manifest how some among
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:204232:178"/> our selves are fallen off from the whole Mystery of it, with respect unto the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ, the <hi>Satisfaction for Sin</hi> made by his Death, the <hi>Attonement</hi> by the Blood of his Sacrifice, <hi>Justification</hi> by his Righteousness, and <hi>Sanctification</hi> by his Spirit. If any shall think themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duely charged herein, they may be pleased to know, that none are intended but those who are really <hi>guilty.</hi> Whoever owns the Things mentioned, though he will cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely make use of peculiar words of his own for their Expression, neither <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> nor <hi>proper,</hi> nor such as Believers have in former Ages been accustomed unto, yet whilest the things themselves are <hi>believed</hi> and <hi>received,</hi> at present we lay nothing to his charge. But, unless to secure a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, useless, irrational Charity, we wilfully shut our Eyes and stop our Ears, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid the Evidence that these things are by many even totally renounced. Yea and this is done by them to the greatest disadvantage of themselves, and dishonour of the Truth that can be well imagined. For their Profession is, that they have tryed Christ and the Gospel in these things, and find there is Nothing in them for which they should <hi>abide</hi> in the Faith of them, or place their Confidence in them.</p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:204232:178"/>
               <p> I hope none of them have gone unto that Length as to cast themselves under the dreadfull Doom in the Apostolical passage insisted on; but that their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is dangerous, cannot be denyed. To prevent the like <hi>state</hi> in our selves and others, we may do well to consider, What are the true, real, next and immediate <hi>Springs</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> of such Mens Apostasie from the Mystery of the Gospel, as added unto the General Reason of all Apostasie of this kind before mentioned. For so it is, that besides those General Reasons and Causes, which have their Efficacy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in all Apostasies, and must alwayes be considered in this matter; there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Reasons that are peculiar unto every especial Instance of Backsliding in any kind.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and the Benefits of his <hi>Mediation</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Life and Salvation, hath betrayd them first into an <hi>Indifferency</hi> about them, and then a <hi>Defection</hi> from them. They want a <hi>true</hi> and in their own Souls a <hi>full</hi> Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>personal</hi> want of these things. Such Apostates arise out of <hi>loose Notional Professors,</hi> who never had any sound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the want of Christ; like them,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:204232:179"/>
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. or him, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 30. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they lived, some of them, a long time in the <hi>outward Profession</hi> that such a Conviction of the <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>use</hi> of Christ and his Grace was <hi>necessary</hi> unto them that would be saved; yet dare they not own that ever themselves had any such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. For if they had, why do they now forsake him as unto those Ends for which they were convinced he was so to be desired? That Faith alone will never forsake Christ, which springs out of, or is built on a Conviction of the want of Him. They who are well and in health will not alwayes esteem the <hi>Physician.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto this <hi>Conviction</hi> of the want of Christ two things are required in all men, according to the measure of the <hi>Light</hi> which they have received.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Nature, Guilt, Filth,</hi> and <hi>Desert</hi> of <hi>Sin.</hi> For he came to save us from our Sin. And no man will look after him to be delivered from he knows not what; or look to the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> who is not stung. Few have any Knowledge hereof but what they cannot avoid, and fewer are <hi>sensible</hi> of these things in a due manner. The great design of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than at this day in the World is, to <hi>exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:204232:179"/> Sin in Opinion, and so <hi>countenance</hi> it in Practice. Indeed it ever was so; but it is in a peculiar manner at present <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>open,</hi> though the Conspiracy be so strong, that a publick Resistance unto it is scarcely maintainable. His Aym in it is and ever was, to take off from the <hi>Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Ʋsefulness</hi> of Christ and his Grace, against which his Malice is principally bent. And when once he can convey away the <hi>Relief,</hi> he will be ready enough to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the <hi>Evil.</hi> Hence are those Opinions so diligently advanced and greedily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, against the <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Depravation</hi> of our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> wherein men of all sorts conspire. Whatever some men may design, his End in them all is no other but to prevent a <hi>Conviction</hi> of the want we have of Christ. So also are Sins in <hi>practice</hi> extenuated, <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Sins against the <hi>Gospel</hi> are made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of, yea laughed at; and <hi>Immoralities</hi> against the Law are lightly esteemed, and easily passed over. To take off at present a <hi>sense</hi> of the want of Christ, and to make way for future Apostasie, is the End of these and the like corrupt Opinions. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it is come to pass in the World. Never was there less Regard of the <hi>Person</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:204232:180"/> and <hi>Offices</hi> of Christ, of his Grace, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his <hi>Mediation,</hi> among them that are called Christians, than is found among many at this Day. Unless God graciously relieve, the World is like to lose Christ out of the Gospel, as to the true Glory of his <hi>Person,</hi> and Use of his <hi>Mediation.</hi> Thus was it with the Generality of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom we speak, they never had a thorow <hi>practical Conviction</hi> of the want of Christ; for if they had, they would not so shamefully have left him as they have done. The general Notions they had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, serve onely to entitle them unto a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> I know these things are despised by many, unto whom the <hi>want</hi> of Christ, and the <hi>receiving</hi> of him, or an <hi>Interest</hi> in him, are contemptible things. But that is all one; we must not foregoe the Gospel, with our own Experience, and ruine our Souls, to escape their Reproaches. Sin will be Sin, and Christ will be Christ, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him will be what it is, when they have done what they can.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Hereunto is required a <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>sence</hi> of the <hi>Weakness</hi> of the Best of our <hi>Duties,</hi> and their utter <hi>Insufficiency</hi> to abide the <hi>Trial</hi> in the sight of God. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the former we cannot <hi>have,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:204232:180"/> the latter we can never <hi>abide</hi> in a Sense of the want of Christ. A right Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Instability</hi> of our Minds in them, the <hi>weak Actings</hi> of Grace for the most part, the <hi>Weariness</hi> of the Flesh that accompanyes them, secret <hi>Impressions</hi> from Self and inward <hi>Oppositions</hi> from Sin that attend them, with the Greatness and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of God with whom we have to doe in them, is indispensibly necessary to keep the Lord Christ and his Grace alwayes <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable</hi> unto us. Want hereof makes some dream of a <hi>Perfection</hi> in themselves, and others of a <hi>Justification</hi> by their own Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; The first tending to the Contempt, the latter unto the Neglect of Christ and his Grace. This is the beginning of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression unto many Apostates. They never had a <hi>due sense of the want of Christ,</hi> either as to their Deliverance from the Guilt of Sin, or as to the procuring of a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness wherewith they might appear in the presence of God. This are they to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after, who shall endeavour their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. To contend with them about their own Imaginations, is for the most part <hi>endless</hi> and <hi>fruitless.</hi> Let it be inquired, whether they ever had any <hi>Conviction</hi> of the want of Christ for the Pardon of Sin,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:204232:181"/> or for the obtaining of Life and Salvation? If they shall grant they had, it may be asked, why they do not make use of him unto the <hi>Ends</hi> with respect whereunto they were convinced of the <hi>want of him?</hi> and if they do so, we have no Contest with them in this matter. If they acknowledge that they never had any such <hi>Conviction,</hi> this is that which we are to confirm, That such a <hi>Conviction of the want of Christ,</hi> is indispensibly necessary unto the Salvation of all that are Adult. And herein we have the Testimony (upon the matter) of the whole Scripture, the Law and the Gospel, to confirm the Truth we contend for. Want therefore hereof was one Spring of this <hi>Defection.</hi> For, those who have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Necessity</hi> of him, or an <hi>Interest</hi> in him, for the <hi>Ends</hi> mentioned; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards declare, that there is nothing of <hi>Goodness</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> in what they have found and discovered, for which they should continue so to doe, their Profession is, That they have <hi>considered</hi> this matter, <hi>known</hi> it, and do <hi>condemn</hi> it; wherein the formal Nature of <hi>Apostasie</hi> doth consist. And all those Disciples which they draw after them, they doe it, by hiding from them or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them off from any sense of a want of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:204232:181"/>
                  <hi>Christ,</hi> or of his <hi>Mediation.</hi> That which is the Foundation of our Profession in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position hereunto, which we lay the weight of all our Eternal Concerns upon, is, That without Christ, before we receive him as set forth by God to be a <hi>Propitiation tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Faith in his Blood,</hi> we are in a lost, undone, and accursed Condition; that our <hi>closing</hi> with him, our <hi>believing</hi> in him, is upon a Conviction of our <hi>want of him</hi> for Life, Righteousness and Acceptation with God, both before and after Believing. And it is in vain for Sathan himself to attempt the <hi>Faith of Gods Elect</hi> herein. A concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of plain Revelation and evident Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is invincible. But he who never knew, who never was made deeply sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the want of an <hi>Interest in Christ,</hi> will never persevere in the pursuit of it, nor abide in what he hath attained when attacqued by any Vigorous Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Want of a <hi>spiritual View</hi> of the <hi>Excellency</hi> of Christ both in his <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> is another Spring and Cause of this Declension from the Faith of the Gospel. This View of him in Types, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Promises, was the Life of the Faith of the Saints under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:204232:182"/> Herein <hi>Abraham saw his day and rejoyced, Joh.</hi> 8. 5, 6. So <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 8, 17. And it is mentioned as their chiefest Priviledge, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 17. These things they <hi>diligently inquired into,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. and <hi>longed after,</hi> desiring (if it were possible) to <hi>see them, Matth.</hi> 13. 17. For the Glory and Life of all Religion, of all Entercourse with God, lay in them from the giving of the first Promise. Christ was <hi>all and in all</hi> unto them no less than unto us. Take a Respect unto Him and his Offices out of the Old Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, and they are things of no value or signification. And it was better for them who were enquiring after Christ diligently under dark Types and Shadows, than it will be for those among us who shut their Eyes at the glorious Light of the Gospel. And the Reason why he was rejected by the <hi>Jews</hi> at his Coming, (for <hi>he came unto his own, and his own received him not, Joh.</hi> 1. 11.) was, because they could <hi>see neither Form, nor Comeliness, nor Beauty in him, why he should be desired, Isa.</hi> 53. 2. None can or will abide constant in his <hi>Doctrine</hi> who are not able <hi>spiritually</hi> to discern the Glory of his <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Offices.</hi> Hence the Apostles lay it down as the Foundation of their Faith; that <hi>they beheld his Glory,</hi>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:204232:182"/>
                  <hi>the Glory as of the onely Begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, full of Grace and Truth, Joh.</hi> 1. 14. And that which they had in themselves they endeavoured to communicate unto others, that they <hi>also might believe through their Word, and have fellowship with Him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. So he himself makes this the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Church, the Rock upon which he will build it. For on the Confession of <hi>Peter,</hi> that he was <hi>the Christ, the Son of the Living God,</hi> (which expresseth the Glory both of his <hi>Person</hi> as the Son of the Living God, and of his <hi>Offices</hi> as the Christ,) he sayes, <hi>On this Rock will I build my Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it; Matth.</hi> 16. 16, 18. Whoever builds not hereon, builds on the <hi>sand,</hi> and will be prevailed against. So our Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that those that <hi>hold him not as the Head,</hi> will be <hi>beguiled,</hi> and <hi>vainly puffed up in their fleshly minds,</hi> falling into foolish Errors, and vain Curiosities; <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18, 19. And he rests the whole Foundation of all Gospel Faith in this Glory of his <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Offices; Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. It is this Knowledge of Him alone, that will make us disesteem and despise all other things in comparison of Him; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 10.</p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:204232:183"/>
               <p> Wherefore, a spiritual <hi>view of him,</hi> an <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with him, as the <hi>Brightnesse of the Glory of the Father,</hi> and the <hi>expresse Image of his Person,</hi> as he in whom all the Perfections of the Divine Nature, as Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodness and Grace, do center, as to their Manifestation, even in the <hi>Ʋnion</hi> of his Natures, the <hi>Glory</hi> of his Offices, the <hi>suitableness</hi> of his <hi>Person</hi> and Grace unto all the Wants and Desires of the Souls of Men, is indispensibly necessary unto our Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from Apostasie. And I could easily manifest by particular Instances, that a fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein hath had a principal and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Influence into all the Apostasies that have been in the Christian World, both as unto <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship.</hi> It is, though a <hi>new,</hi> yet a most <hi>wicked</hi> Attempt that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is making by some against the whole of our Religion, whilest allowing his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> to be what it is, (which for secular Ends they dare not deny,) they endeavour to render him of little or no use in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. This is to fight neither against small nor great, but against the <hi>King of Israel.</hi> And if such serpentine Attempts be not prevented, the <hi>publick Profession</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among us will issue in <hi>Atheism,</hi> or somewhat of a near Alliance thereunto.</p>
               <pb n="343" facs="tcp:204232:183"/>
               <p> Thus it seems to be with some of them of whom we speak. They had among other Notional Professors, an <hi>historical</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, and thereof made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; but they were never <hi>spiritually</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the glorious <hi>Excellencies</hi> of his Person and Offices. For if they had, they would not have forsaken the <hi>great Mystery of Godliness, God manifested in the flesh,</hi> for other uncouth Notions of their own. Who can think it possible, that any one who hath known the <hi>Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> the Lord of Glory, the <hi>Son of God Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> receiving our Nature into an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical Union with himself, and a blessed Subsistence in his own Person, as proposed unto us in the Gospel, as evidently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Crucified before our Eyes, as the <hi>Apostle and High-Priest of our Profession,</hi> as our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> with the Father, as making Peace for us and Reconciliation through the Blood of his Cross, as made of God unto us <hi>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption;</hi> who ever had Experience or Benefit in their Temptations and Trials of his Love, Care, Tenderness, Compassion, Readiness and Ability to succour them that <hi>come to God by him;</hi> can Renounce all these things, to betake themselves to vain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:204232:184"/> of a <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> in their stead. I hope they are few who do so <hi>practically,</hi> but the Expressions of many have a dangerous Aspect that way. And it is certain, there is nothing more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary unto all that are called Christians, than to have clear distinct Notions in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> and plainly to declare, How they place their whole Faith, Hope and Trust in Him. And for such as really do so, though not able to express themselves in a due Manner, yea though unduely captivated unto some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel Conceptions and Expressions, the Good Lord pardon them, and let Mercy and Peace be on them, and on the whole <hi>Israel</hi> of God. Whereas therefore some who have made a Profession of these things, do now Relinquish them, I shall pray they may take heed that they do not thereby <hi>crucifie the Son of God afresh, and put him to open shame.</hi> Neither is it a <hi>verbal</hi> Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement in owning that Christ which suffered at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which will free any from this Charge and Guilt. Unless the Lord Christ, that Christ which is <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> in one Person, be owned, received, believed in, loved, trusted unto, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all things, as he is proposed unto us
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:204232:184"/> in the Scripture, and with respect unto all the Ends of Righteousness, Holiness, Life and Salvation, for which he is so proposed, he is <hi>renounced</hi> and forsaken. Who can sufficiently express the cunning Sleights of Sathan? who can sufficiently bewail the Foolishness of the Hearts of Men, that after they have (at least Doctrinally) known, and professed these things, they should be turned aside from the Glory, Truth, and Holiness of them? Let Christians therefore know and beware, that if they find any Decay in Faith, Love, Delight, and Trust in the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Mediation</hi> of Christ, they are in the way that leads to some cursed Apostasie of one kind or another.</p>
               <p>But where the <hi>Divine Person</hi> of Christ is denyed, or all Acquaintance with him is despised; where the Communication of <hi>Grace</hi> from him unto Believers is scorned, where no use by Faith of his <hi>Love, Care, Compassion</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> as our High-Priest and Advocate with the Father in our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Sins, Temptations, and Sufferings, is allowed; we need not represent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling into <hi>Apostasie,</hi> such Persons are already in the depth of it. I speak this with the more Earnestness, because, of all the Evils which I have seen in the Course
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:204232:185"/> of my Pilgrimage, (now hastning unto its Period) there hath been none more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than the publick Contempt I have lived to see cast on the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, as to its Concernment in our Religion, and the Benefits we receive from him. But God taketh care of these things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Want of <hi>Experience</hi> of the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> of his Life and Death for the <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> of Sin, hath been another Spring of this Apostasie. How it is wrought by these Means, and can be no otherwise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, I have shewed elsewhere at large, and must not here assume the same Argument again. Onely two things may be observed concerning this Work and Duty. As,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) It is that wherein, or whereunto the greatest <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Exercise</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> doth consist, or is required. It is a matter purely <hi>Evangelical</hi> to derive Strength and Ability from Christ for the <hi>Mortification</hi> of Sin, by vertue of his Death, in a way of Believing. Unenlightened Reason can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther see nor understand any thing of this matter, yea it is <hi>foolishness</hi> unto it, as are all other Mysteries of the Gospel. There is not any other way for the same End,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:204232:185"/> which it will not more willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) It is a Work and Duty whereunto there is a great <hi>Reluctancy in the Flesh,</hi> in corrupted Nature. There is nothing it had rather be freed from, and that whether we respect the <hi>inward Nature</hi> of it, or the <hi>constant Continuance</hi> in it that is required of us. Yet is it such, as that without it we can never attain Life and Salvation; <hi>for if we by the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the Flesh, we shall live,</hi> and not otherwise. Wherefore, when men once begin to be sensible of the powerfull inward Workings of Sin, they will take one of these two wayes, nor can they do otherwise. For either they will <hi>yield</hi> themselves up <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unto Sin,</hi> and make <hi>provision for the Flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof,</hi> according as they are able, and as far as consists with their Secular Interest, as doe the most; or they will betake themselves to some Way or other for its <hi>Restraint</hi> and <hi>Mortification,</hi> either in <hi>part</hi> or in <hi>whole.</hi> And here many things will present themselves unto such persons, some (it may be) of their own Devising, and some of Gods Appointment, but for <hi>other Ends</hi> than what they apply them unto. Hence Multitudes faint in this
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:204232:186"/> Work, and at length utterly give it over. They begin in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and end in the <hi>Flesh.</hi> For not <hi>striving lawfully,</hi> nor in the right Way, Sin gets ground and strength against them, and they yield up themselves to the Service of it. Hence have we so many, who having under their Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contended against their Lusts in their <hi>Youth,</hi> do give up themselves unto them in their <hi>Age.</hi> But so it is in this matter, that those who through their <hi>Ʋnbelief</hi> cannot arise or attain unto an Experience of the Power and Efficacy of the Grace of Christ for the <hi>Mortification</hi> of Sin, will betake themselves to somewhat else for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. And this is that principally which hath brought forth that <hi>Light within</hi> among some, which must doe all this work for them, and much more. If any will betake themselves thereunto, they shall find that Remedy against Sin, and that Perfection of Holiness in a <hi>few dayes,</hi> which they had been looking for from Christ a <hi>long season</hi> to no purpose. So would they have us to think, who it may be never had Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence what it is to derive spiritual Strength from Christ, or to wait on him for it; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have been wearied by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesselesness of their Convictions, and the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:204232:186"/> burdensomeness of Lifeless Duties. For some of them were for a Season not onely <hi>sober</hi> in their Conversation (which I hope they yet continue to be,) but <hi>diligent</hi> in Duties of Religion. But finding neither <hi>life, power,</hi> nor <hi>success</hi> in them, through their own uncured Unbelief, they seem to have grown weary of them. For nothing is more grievous than the <hi>outward Form</hi> of spiritual Duties, where there is no Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of <hi>inward Power</hi> and Sweetness. Wherefore, the corrupt Minds of men will be ready to relinquish them, for any thing that pretends a better Relief.</p>
               <p>What was the Reason that so many in the <hi>Papacy</hi> betook themselves to <hi>Penances,</hi> severe <hi>Disciplines</hi> and <hi>Self-macerations,</hi> for the Relief of their Consciences with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto the <hi>Mortification</hi> of <hi>Sin?</hi> It all sprang from this Root, or Ignorance of the Power and Efficacy of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ for that End. Somewhat must be done unto this purpose, and not knowing the right Way and Gospel-Method of it, they betook themselves unto what they could invent, or what was imposed on them by the Superstition of others, that pretended to afford them a Relief. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hereof those among us seemed for a
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:204232:187"/> while to make an Appearance of, in an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Gravity, and seeming Austerity of Life; but the Things themselves they had no mind unto, as not complyant with other Interests they had to pursue. But the <hi>Light within</hi> shall do all of this Kind for them; wherefore, in comparison thereof, and as unto this End at least, they reject the Lord Christ, and do what in them lyes to <hi>put him to open shame.</hi> For what do they less, who declare, that that is done in a <hi>few dayes</hi> for them by <hi>another Means,</hi> which could not be effected <hi>by the Faith which for so long a season</hi> they professed in him? But the Cause of the whole lyes solely in their own <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and want of <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of the things which themselves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Ignorance of the Righteousness of God,</hi> hath been another Spring of this Apostasie. This the Apostle expressely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be the Reason why men <hi>goe about to establish a Righteousness of their own; Rom.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Being ignorant of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, and going about to establish their own Righteousness, they have not submitted unto the Righteousness of God.</hi> And this he speaks of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that the Best of them, who followed after Righteousness,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:204232:187"/> and <hi>sought</hi> it, as <hi>it were by the works of the Law; Rom.</hi> 9. 31, 32. Of all men they thought themselves most Knowing of the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God, for they made <hi>their boast of God, and knew</hi> (as they thought and professed) <hi>his Will, and approved the things that are more excellent, being instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Law, and were confident that they themselves were Guides of the Blind, and the Light of them that are in Darkness, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structers of the Foolish, and Teachers of Babes, having the Form of Knowledge, and of the Truth in the Law; Rom.</hi> 2. 17, 18, 19, 20. Yet these men <hi>submitted not</hi> to the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> of God, but went about to <hi>establish</hi> their own <hi>Righteousness,</hi> because they were ignorant of the Righteousness of God. And wheresoever this Ignorance is, men will doe so.</p>
               <p>Take the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God in any sence wherein it is mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and this Event will follow upon the Ignorance thereof. For it must be either the Righteousness that is <hi>in him,</hi> or the Righteousness he requires <hi>of us</hi> in the Law, or the Righteousness he hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>for us</hi> in the Gospel. Consider it any of these wayes, and the Ignorance of it is that which countenanceth men in betaking
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:204232:188"/> themselves unto a Righteousness of their <hi>own,</hi> yea, unavoidably casteth them upon it. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) A right understanding of the <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Purity,</hi> the glorious <hi>Essential Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, of his absolute <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteousness,</hi> as the Lord and Judge of all; will teach men what Apprehensions they ought to have of any thing done <hi>in</hi> them or <hi>by</hi> them. <hi>Our God is a consuming Fire, Heb.</hi> 12. 29. <hi>A God of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity, Hab.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Who will in no wise acquit the guilty, Exod.</hi> 34. 7. Whose <hi>judgement</hi> it is, that <hi>they who commit sin are worthy of Death, Rom.</hi> 1. 32. <hi>An Holy God, a Jealous God, that will not forgive Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions and Sins, Josh.</hi> 24. 19. Whilest the Dread and Terror of the Excellency of this Holiness and Righteousness is before men, they will not easily betake themselves and their Trust unto a Righteousness of their own. There are two sorts of Persons that the Scripture represents under an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of this Righteousness of God. The first are <hi>convinced guilty Sinners,</hi> and the other <hi>humble holy Believers:</hi> And what thoughts of themselves each sort is thereon filled withall, it doth declare. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sort, we have an Instance in <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:204232:188"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 10. In <hi>others, Isa.</hi> 33. 14. as also, <hi>Micah.</hi> 6. 7. The summe is, they can think of nothing, have no other Conceptions in their Minds, but how either they may <hi>flye</hi> from him, and <hi>hide</hi> themselves; or feign to themselves impossible wayes of <hi>Attonement;</hi> or be swallowed up in Horror and Despair. Send them in this Condition unto a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of their own, and they will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand you do but reproach their Misery. And for the other sort or <hi>humble holy Believers,</hi> we may see also how on this Occasion they express themselves in this matter; <hi>Job</hi> 4. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 6. They all joyntly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that such is the glorious Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Righteousness of God, such the Imperfection of our Righteousness and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of our Works, that there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance or standing before him on their Account. It is the want of a due Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, that hath produced the many presumptuous Opinions in the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Justification</hi> of Sinners. The Scripture speaking of Justification, directs us to conceive <hi>it in the sight of God, Psal.</hi> 130. 2. or <hi>before him, Rom.</hi> 3. 20. Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that in this matter we should set our selves as in the presence and under the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:204232:189"/> Eye of this Holy God, and then consider on what <hi>Ground</hi> we may <hi>stand</hi> before him. But where men are <hi>ignorant of this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God,</hi> when they have secret thoughts that he is <hi>altogether such an one as themselves</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks; that is, one who is either not so Holy in himself as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or one who doth not require a <hi>suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in us unto his Holiness, but is little concerned in our Duties, less in our Sins; is it any wonder if men think they can of themselves do that which is Satisfactory unto him, and so <hi>goe about to establish their own Righteousness?</hi> And this way even in <hi>Teaching</hi> have some betaken themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. They endeavour to satisfie their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that there is no such <hi>severity</hi> in God against <hi>Sin</hi> as some pretend, no such <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in his Nature as necessarily to inferre an Indignation against every Sin; that they are but <hi>vain frights</hi> and needless Disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which either their own Consciences or the Preaching of some men do put them unto. And if they can prevail to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited herein, there is no doubt but that those whom they so perswade will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with their own Righteousness; but whether God in this matter of <hi>Justification</hi> will be pleased with it or no, is not so easie to be determined.</p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:204232:189"/>
               <p> And hence it is, that all Opinions of a <hi>Self-righteousness</hi> or <hi>Justification by Works,</hi> have alwayes produced <hi>Licentiousness</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> though they who assert it clamorously pretend to the contrary. So when a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of <hi>Works</hi> was absolutely enthroned in the <hi>Papacy</hi> before the Reformation, the Lives of the generality of men were flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously Wicked, and most of the <hi>good works</hi> that were performed amongst them, were but <hi>Barterings</hi> with God and Conscience for horrible Vices and Impietyes. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also unto the growth of the same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in its various degrees among us, is the Progress also of all sorts of Impiety and Licentiousness of Life. And if the Masters of these Opinions would but open their Eyes, they would see, that whereas they assert their <hi>Justification by Works</hi> under a pretence of a Necessity so to doe, for the Maintenance of Holiness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness among men, that Unholiness, Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Intemperance of Life, and all Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations do grow upon them, such as were not heard of in former dayes among them who made any Profession of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the Reason hereof is, because the very same Notions of God which will allow men to suppose that they may be
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:204232:190"/>
                  <hi>justified</hi> in his sight by their own Duties, will also accommodate their Lusts with several Apprehensions that he will not be so <hi>severe</hi> against their Sins as is supposed. However this is plain in matter of Fact, that the Opinion of <hi>Self-righteousness</hi> and <hi>Looseness</hi> of Conversation in the practice of Sin, have gone together generally, from the dayes of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to this present season. And as this proud Conceit receives daily Advancement in several Degrees, under various Pretences, it is to be feared the World will be more and more filled with the bitter Fruits thereof. It is <hi>Grace</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it, as well as its <hi>Power,</hi> that must put a stop to Sin. He that drives men into a Righteousness of their <hi>own</hi> at one door, opens another unto their Sins. And all that we have got hitherto by fierce Disputations about <hi>Justification</hi> as it were by <hi>Works,</hi> is only that the Faith of some hath been weakened, the Peace of Multitudes disquieted, Differences encreased, without the least Evidence of Holiness improved, or the Vices of men reformed by them. And it will not be granted, that the strictest Professors in these dayes, (whether they have imbibed these Opinions or no,) do in real Holiness and Fruitfulness of Life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:204232:190"/> those of the fore-going Age, who firmly and without Hesitation trusted unto the Lord Christ alone, for Life, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Suppose the <hi>Righteousness</hi> God <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us in the Law,</hi> to <hi>be intended;</hi> the Ignorance thereof also is a great Reason why men venture on a <hi>Righteousness</hi> of their own, and go about to establish it. Were they indeed acquainted with the <hi>purity, spirituality, severity,</hi> and <hi>inexorableness</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> they would never be possessed with Imaginations that the <hi>Perfection</hi> which they dream of in themselves, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure its Trial. But when men shall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the Law respects onely <hi>outward</hi> Duties, and those also of the greatest No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriety as to <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and can relieve themselves in sundry things by <hi>pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaical</hi> Distinctions and Expositions of it, when they consider not, or understand not the extent of it unto an exacting of the entire <hi>Image</hi> of God in us wherein we were created, unto the regulating all the Frames, Figments and first Motions of the Heart, and its Application of the <hi>Curse</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the least Deviation from it; they may please or some way satisfie themselves <hi>by establishing a Righteousness of their own,</hi> as
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:204232:191"/> it were <hi>by the Works of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, (3) The <hi>Righteousness of God</hi> in this place is taken principally for that <hi>Righteousness</hi> which he hath <hi>provided for us</hi> in the Gospel. And what this is, the Apostle declares in the next Verse; <hi>For</hi> (says he) <hi>Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness unto every one that believeth,</hi> ver. 4. And this he calls the <hi>Righteousness which is of Faith,</hi> Chap. 9. ver. 30. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Righteousness of God is Christ as fulfilling the Law, and answering the End of it, received by Faith. This is that <hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> which whosoever are ignorant of, and submit not unto, they will go about to establish a Righteousness of their own, and trust unto it. And thus hath it openly and visibly fallen out with them concerning whom we treat. They will not deny but that under their <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> they were solicitous after a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness with which God might be well pleased. And if they should deny it, they were not to be believed; because it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible it should be otherwise with any in that Condition: For <hi>Conviction</hi> is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally a sense of the want of a <hi>Righteousness.</hi> In this state the Gospel which they had, and which it may be they heard preached,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:204232:191"/> presented unto them <hi>Christ as the End of the Law for Righteousness unto them that do believe;</hi> as it is fully declared; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25; with Chap. 5. 18, 19. This divers of them for a season professed themselves to embrace and acquiesce in. But when things came to the Trial, it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally appeared that they had all along been Ignorant of this <hi>Righteousness of God;</hi> for they have left it for a Righteousness of their <hi>own,</hi> which had they truely and really known it, they could not have done. He who hath ever truely and really made Christ the End of the Law for <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> unto himself by Believing, will not cast Contempt and Scorn upon his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness imputed unto us, as it is the manner of some to doe. But herein is the Son of God in some measure <hi>crucified afresh, and put unto open shame.</hi> When men shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that they did look after Righteousness by him, and would have received him as the End of the Law for Righteousness, but not finding that therein which they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they have betaken themselves to a Righteousness wholly <hi>within</hi> them, and so <hi>wholly</hi> their own; they will not easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a way whereby they may reflect more Dishonour upon him. Whatever pretences
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:204232:192"/> may be made to the contrary, whatever Maze of words any may lead men into, and tire them withall, whatever Revilings and Reproaching of others they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass them with, they cannot but know in their own Consciences that it is thus with them; notwithstanding any Profession that they ever made, they never did come nor ever could attain unto a real Knowledge of and Acquaintance with this <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God,</hi> so as to receive it by Faith, and obtain thereby rest unto their Souls. And thence it is that as unto Profession at least, they have betaken themselves unto an Endeavour <hi>to establish their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> which if it produce and effect a real holy Conversation and Righteousness in them of any long continuance, they are the first in whom it ever had that Effect in this World, and will be the last in whom it shall find that Success.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Want of Submission unto the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God, hath contributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the furtherance of this Evil. The <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> of God acting it self in infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grace, is the sole Foundation of the Covenant of Grace, and runs through the whole Mystery of the Gospel. Thence proceeded the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:204232:192"/> God, and his being filled with all Grace to be a Saviour; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. Other Account thereof none can be given. Thence was his Substitution as the Surety of the Covenant in our stead, to undergoe the punishment due to our Sins, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 6, 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. Eternal <hi>Election</hi> flows from thence, and is regulated thereby; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11, 18. So doth Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Vocation; Matth.</hi> 11. 25, 26. and <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 30. The like may be said of all other Mysteries of the Gospel. Love, Grace, Goodness, dispensed in a way of <hi>sovereign</hi> unaccountable Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, are in them all proposed as the Objects of our Faith. The <hi>carnal Mind</hi> is pleased with nothing of all this, but riseth up in Opposition unto every Instance of it. It will not bear that the Will, Wisdom and Pleasure of God, should be submitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and adored in the Paths which it cannot trace. Hence the Incarnation and Cross of the Son of God are <hi>foolishness</hi> unto it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23, 24, 25. The Decrees of God as to <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> unjust and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, overthrowing all Religion; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>Justification</hi> through the Imputation of the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of Christ, that which everts the Law, and renders
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:204232:193"/> all our own Righteousness unnecessary. So in the whole Mystery, in all the Doctrine, Precepts, or Promises of the Gospel, that spring from or are resolved into the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> of God, the <hi>carnal Mind</hi> riseth up in Opposition unto them all. For whereas the formal Nature of Faith consisteth in <hi>giving Glory to God</hi> by Believing the things that are <hi>above</hi> Reason as it is <hi>ours,</hi> and <hi>against</hi> it as <hi>carnal, Rom.</hi> 4. 18, 19, 20, 21. this sets up an <hi>Enmity</hi> unto it in all things. It is therefore alwayes tumultuating against the Mysteries of the Gospel, and if it once come to make it self the Judge of them, taking Aid from sensual Affections, and the vain Imaginations of the Mind, it will make Havock of all the Articles of Faith. And thus it seems to have fallen out in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Those concerning whom we treat, seem to have cast off a due Regard unto the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God, because themselves were never bowed by Faith savingly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Wherefore in an Opposition unto it, they have set up their <hi>Light within</hi> as the Rule, Measure and Judge of the Truths and Doctrines of the Gospel. In stead of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Fools</hi> by a Resignation of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Wisdom to the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God, that so they might in the Issue be really
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:204232:193"/>
                  <hi>Wise,</hi> they have become <hi>wise</hi> in their own Conceit, and have waxed vain in their <hi>foolish Imaginations.</hi> Neither indeed is there any broader way of Apostasie from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, than a Rejection of Gods <hi>Sovereignty</hi> in all things concerning the Revelation of Himself and our Obedience, with a Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal to bring into Captivity every Thought unto the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> which first brought forth <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> and of late <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianisme,</hi> as hath been shewed, from which two the whole of the present <hi>Defection</hi> is derived.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, We may adde hereunto, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spring of this <hi>partial Apostasie,</hi> want of an Evidence in themselves of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> It is not enough to establish any man in the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gospel, to own in general that the Scripture is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> or a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation</hi> of his Will. He that hath not an Experience of a <hi>Divine Authority</hi> in it upon his own Soul and Conscience, will not be steadfast when his Trial shall come. God looks with regard unto them alone <hi>who tremble at his Word,</hi> as owning his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Authority in it. Where this doth not abide upon them, <hi>unlearned and unstable men</hi> (as the Apostle speaks,) will be bold
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:204232:194"/> to wrest the Scriptures to their destruction, or to preferre other things before them, or at least to equalize them with them. It is not therefore enough that we assent unto the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Word of God, unless also we are sensible of its <hi>Power,</hi> and of that Claim which it makes in the <hi>Name of God,</hi> of the absolute <hi>Subjection</hi> of our whole Souls and Consciences unto it. Now this Evidence in themselves of this present <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority,</hi> differing it unconceivably from all other <hi>real</hi> or <hi>pretended</hi> Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Truth, these Persons either never had, or have insensibly lost, or cast off openly the Yoke of God therein. Hereon every <hi>Imagination</hi> of their own, exalts it self into an Equality of Right and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with it. The End of these things is, that God gives men up to <hi>strong Delusions to believe a Lye,</hi> because they <hi>received not,</hi> or <hi>retained not the Truth in the Love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. And when once it comes unto this, it is the work of Sathan (which he easily accomplisheth,) both to suggest unto them endless <hi>Delusions,</hi> and to render them so Obstinate therein, as that they shall despise every thing that is tendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Conviction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the first Way whereby men <hi>fall</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:204232:194"/>
                  <hi>away</hi> from the Gospel, namely, from the <hi>Mystery</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it as it is the Object of our <hi>Faith;</hi> wherein they doe what in them lyes, <hi>to crucifie the Son of God afresh, and to put him unto open shame.</hi>

But let the whole World (as it were) lye in Evil, let the generality of Mankind drown themselves in Lusts and Pleasures, let the Lives and Conversations of men be as contrary to the <hi>Rule</hi> of the Gospel as Darkness is to Light, so they make no Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in this or that Way of <hi>outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> and be either good <hi>Catholicks,</hi> or good <hi>Protestants,</hi> or any thing else of that kind; he shall scarcely escape the Censure of <hi>Peevishness</hi> and <hi>Severity</hi> (it may be of <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceitedness</hi> and <hi>Hipocrisie)</hi> who shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect any great Blame on these things. And yet notwithstanding this <hi>Partiality</hi> in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Practice, with respect unto these Evils, it is generally acknowledged that it is possible that men may please God and be accepted with him, notwithstanding
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:204232:195"/> many Mistakes, Errors, and Misconceptions of their Minds about <hi>spiritual things;</hi> but that any one should ever come unto the Enjoyment of Him, who Lives and Dyes <hi>impenitently</hi> in any Sin against the Rule and Tenor of that <hi>Holiness</hi> which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel requireth, I know as yet none that pleadeth. For once to pretend that men may <hi>live in,</hi> and <hi>habitually act</hi> any known Sin, without striving against it, labouring for Repentance, and endeavouring its Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, is all one as avowedly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the overthrow of Christian Religion. Wherefore, on these and sundry other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, this latter sort of <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the Gospel, is at least as <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous,</hi> as much to be opposed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against, as that which is from the <hi>Mystery</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it; and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Generality of men▪ are more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to be warned, as the Evil where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are more <hi>obnoxious</hi> than to the other. And we do conjoyn both these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, not onely as those which are of the same tendency, and do alike both <hi>ruine</hi> the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, and <hi>put the Lord Christ to open shame,</hi> but also as those concerning which we are forewarned that they shall enter into and come in the World together
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:204232:196"/> in the <hi>latter dayes.</hi> And whatever sence the <hi>latter dayes</hi> mentioned in the Scripture may be taken in, either those of the <hi>World</hi> and of <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> for of the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches</hi> whereunto men may belong, they are unquestionably come upon us, whose Danger and Duty therefore is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in these Pre-admonitions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of the first our Apostle speaketh, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>The Spirit speaketh expressely, that in the latter times some shall depart from the Faith, giving heed unto seducing Spirits and the Doctrines of Devils.</hi> I doubt not but this Prediction had its signal Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment in the <hi>Papacy;</hi> and am well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that the Holy Ghost had respect in particular unto those Principles and Practices which a Learned Person of this Nation hath laid open under the Title of <hi>The Apostacy of the latter times.</hi> But we find also by wofull Experience, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed almost every day, that it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto <hi>us also</hi> and the Times wherein we live.</p>
               <p>The Entrance and Coming of that Kind of <hi>Apostasie</hi> which we have now designed to treat of, is in like manner foretold, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; The summe of what the Apostle there instructeth us, is, That in
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:204232:196"/> these <hi>latter times</hi> under an <hi>outward Profession</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> men should give up themselves unto the <hi>pursuit</hi> of the <hi>vilest Lusts,</hi> and the <hi>practice</hi> of the most <hi>abominable Sins.</hi> And we fear this <hi>prediction</hi> is in like manner fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Now although these things are Evil and Dangerous, both in their own <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Tendency,</hi> especially as they come together and make their joynt Attempt against the <hi>Honour</hi> of Christ, and the <hi>Salvation</hi> of the Professors of the Gospel; yet this <hi>Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of them, and <hi>Pre-admonition</hi> concerning them may be of advantage unto them that are <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>upright,</hi> if duely improved.</p>
               <p>For, (1) If this two-fold ruinous <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> will and doth press upon Us, on whom these Ends of the World are come, we ought surely to <hi>stand upon our Guard,</hi> that we be not <hi>surprized</hi> with it, nor <hi>overcome</hi> by it. How ought <hi>we to spend our Sojourning here in Fear?</hi> It was the Advice of him whose Confidence had like to have been his Ruine. It is assuredly no time for any to be <hi>careless</hi> and <hi>secure,</hi> who design or so much as desire to be preserved from this <hi>fatal Evil.</hi> However we cannot any of us plead, that we were not warned of our <hi>Danger,</hi> nor called on for that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection and Watchfulness, that Care and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:204232:197"/> Diligence, that Earnestness for <hi>Divine Help</hi> and Assistance, which our Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, and which will be a Means of <hi>Deliverance</hi> and <hi>Safety.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Being found in the way of our own <hi>Duty,</hi> we need not be greatly <hi>moved</hi> or <hi>shaken in our Minds</hi> when we see these things come to pass. It may be a Prospect of the <hi>State of Religion</hi> at this day in the World, is ready to terrifie the Minds of some, at least to fill them with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For if things should alwayes so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, they may be afraid lest <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> should at length lose all its Beauty and Glory. But these things are all of them punctually foretold, whereby the Efficacy of the Temptation from their coming to pass, is prevented. Yea considering that all our Faith is resolved into the Scripture, and built on the Infallibility of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies and Predictions, seeing they are foretold, the Temptation would be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with more Vigour and Efficacy if we saw them not come to pass, than it is now we doe; seeing it is evident from other Circumstances, that we are fallen into the <hi>latter dayes,</hi> which the Accomplishment of these Predictions renders unquestionable. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 24. <hi>Acts</hi>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:204232:197"/> 20. 29, 30. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And the truth is, there was never any perswasion more pernicious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell the Minds of men, than that Churches, this or that Church, or any Church, are not, or is not lyable or obnoxious unto these Decayes, Declensions and Apostasies; or that any in them or of them can be preserved from them, without the utmost Care and Diligence in attending unto the Means appointed for their Preservation. When the <hi>Jews</hi> fell into such a foolish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence with respect unto their <hi>Temple</hi> and Worship, God was wont to bid them goe to <hi>Shilo,</hi> and see what was become there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; as assuring them that what fell out in one Time and Place, might doe so in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And we know how it was in this matter with the first <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> and how soon, (as hath been declared,) <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 4, 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4; 14, 15, 16, 17. We may <hi>goe to them</hi> and learn how vain are all the Pretences of outward Priviledges and Exemptions; for assuredly, <hi>unless we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent we shall all likewise perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That therefore which we shall now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into, is, the <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Causes,</hi> and <hi>Occasions</hi> of that Apostasie or falling off from the <hi>Holiness of the Gospel</hi> in Churches and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:204232:198"/> by particular persons, which is thus fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told to fall out in the <hi>latter dayes,</hi> and hath done so accordingly. And we shall have respect herein both unto that <hi>general Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> of this kind which fell out in former Ages under the Conduct of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> principally, and that also which by various Wayes and Means is at present pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in the World. And some things must be premised unto our Consideration hereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Doctrine of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Holiness.</hi> This it teacheth, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and commandeth. This the <hi>Mysteries</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of it lead unto; this the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> of it require, and this the great <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of its <hi>Author</hi> proposed in it unto us, doth enjoyn. And it doth not this as that which is <hi>convenient</hi> for us, or some way or other <hi>necessary</hi> unto us, but as that without which we can have no Interest in any of its <hi>Promises.</hi> No <hi>unholy Person</hi> hath any ground to expect the least Advantage by the Gospel here or hereafter. When all things come to their issue, and shall fall under Eternal Judgment according to the Gospel, all other Pleas and Pretences will utterly and for ever fail them who are <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Iniquity, Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:204232:198"/> 2. The <hi>Holiness</hi> which the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth is an <hi>Obedience</hi> of another <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Kind</hi> than what is required by any other Doctrine or way of Instruction. The <hi>Law of Nature</hi> continueth to suggest unto us many important Duties towards God, our selves, and other men. The <hi>written Law</hi> is an exact Representation of all those <hi>Moral Duties</hi> which were required of us in the state wherein we were created. But there is an <hi>Holiness</hi> required by the Gospel which although it include these things within the compass of its Law and Order, yet (on sundry Considerations) is of another <hi>kind</hi> than what is required by those Laws, in the <hi>Manner</hi> wherein it is required in them. For it proceedeth from other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, on another formal Reason and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, hath other essential Properties, Acts, Duties and Ends, than the Obedience by them required hath. This hath been so fully evinced in our Discourse of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Necessity of Gospel-Holiness,</hi> that it need not be here again insisted on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Together with the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Gospel, or the Preaching of it, there is an <hi>Administration of the Spirit</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince men of Sin, Righteousness, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This God hath <hi>promised, Isa.</hi> 59. 21.
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:204232:199"/> and this the Lord Christ doth <hi>effect,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Word is Orderly dispensed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto his Mind and Will, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Hereby are men wrought upon unto a <hi>Profession</hi> of this Holiness, and <hi>Expression</hi> of it in outward Duties. For all that Religion which hath any thing of Truth and Reality in it in the World, is an Effect of the Word and Spirit of Christ. Multitudes in all Ages have hereby been made <hi>really holy,</hi> and many yet continue so to be. These (as we believe,) shall never fall utterly from it, but shall be preserved by <hi>the Power of God through Faith unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But yet such as these also may decay as unto <hi>Degrees</hi> in Holiness, and the <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of it. And in every such Decay there is a <hi>partial Apostasie,</hi> and much Dishonour unto <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> nor doth any man know in that Condition but that in the issue as to his particular, it may be <hi>total</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to his Soul. Thus was it with those <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> whom our Lord Jesus Christ chargeth to have <hi>lost their first Faith and Love,</hi> whom he admonisheth to <hi>remember whence they are fallen,</hi> and <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> And it is principally for the sake of these, that Christ and the Gospel be not dishonoured by them, nor their Eternal
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:204232:199"/> Concernments hazarded, and those who in the use of Means are in a thriving progress towards the same Condition, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Cautions and Warnings are prepared. And others there are who are brought onely unto a <hi>Profession</hi> of this Holiness, in <hi>inward Convictions</hi> and <hi>outward Dutyes.</hi> And although they are not yet arrived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a full possession of its <hi>Power</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto its <hi>Rule,</hi> yet are they in the Way of attaining thereunto. Such as these may (on various occasions) first <hi>decay</hi> in their <hi>Profession</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> and afterwards utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>fall from them</hi> into the open Service of Sin and the World.</p>
               <p>Thus also it is with Churches. At their first Planting, they were set in a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy state,</hi> as to the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> professed <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> of the Gospel. They were all planted <hi>Noble Vines,</hi> wholly of a <hi>right seed,</hi> however they turn afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>degenerate Plant of a strange Vine.</hi> They may lose of this <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> part with <hi>Truth,</hi> decay in <hi>Holiness,</hi> and the <hi>faithful City thereby become an Harlot.</hi> How this hath come to pass, how thereby <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> hath lost its Glory, Power, and Efficacy in the World, how that Blessing which it brought along with it unto the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:204232:200"/> Nations, is lost and forfeited, and by what Means, shall in some principal Instances be declared.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Where this <hi>Holiness</hi> is professed, and the <hi>Power</hi> of it evidenced in its <hi>Fruits,</hi> there, and then <hi>alone</hi> is <hi>Christ glorified</hi> and Honoured in the World. It is true, there are other things that belong unto that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of Glory which our Lord and King requireth of us. Such are the Profession of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and Observance of the <hi>Worship</hi> of the Gospel. But if these things are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and separate (as they may be) from <hi>holy Obedience,</hi> they no way advance the <hi>Glory of Christ.</hi> But where Churches and Persons professing the <hi>Gospel,</hi> are <hi>changed</hi> and <hi>renewed into the Image of God,</hi> where their Hearts are <hi>purified</hi> within, and their Lives made <hi>fruitfull</hi> without, where they are <hi>universally</hi> under the Conduct of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Peace, Love, Meekness, Benignity, Self-denyal, Heavenly-mindedness, and are <hi>fruitfull</hi> in <hi>good Works,</hi> in which things and other of an alike Nature this <hi>Holiness</hi> doth consist; there do they make <hi>a due Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation</hi> of the Gospel and its Author in the World, then do they evidence the <hi>Power, Purity</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of his Doctrine and Grace, whereby he is <hi>glorified.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:204232:200"/> doth he <hi>see of the Travail of his Soul and is satisfied;</hi> this is his <hi>portion</hi> and <hi>the Lot of his Inheritance</hi> in this World. But where it is otherwise, where Men, where Churches are called by his <hi>Name,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Profession of his <hi>Authority,</hi> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Eternal Blessedness</hi> from him, do come short of this <hi>Holiness,</hi> and walk in Paths contrary unto it, there is the holy Son of God <hi>crucifyed afresh, and put to open shame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things being premised, way is made for the due Consideration of what was before proposed. For whereas there is an open shamefull manifest <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the Gospel, among the most who are <hi>called Christians</hi> at this day in the World, it is worth our while to enquire a little into the Reasons or Causes of it, and the Means whereby a stop may be put unto it, or at least <hi>particular Persons</hi> may be preserved from the Guilt of it, and the Judgements wherein it will issue. If any shall think that there is not such an <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> in the World, but that the Face of things in <hi>Europe</hi> and among our selves doth make a <hi>due Representation</hi> of the Gospel, and that those things which we hear of and see continually amongst the generality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:204232:201"/> are the true and genuine Effect of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; I shall no way contend with them, so as that they will but a little stand out of our way, and not hinder us in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Apostasie</hi> that is in the World from <hi>Gospel-Holiness</hi> or <hi>Evangelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> is of two Kinds. For some fall from it as <hi>formally such,</hi> and others as to the <hi>matter</hi> of it. Of the first sort are they who would advance <hi>another Kind of Obedience,</hi> a Course of another sort of Duties, or the same as to the <hi>substance</hi> of them, but as proceeding from other <hi>Principles,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on by other <hi>Motives</hi> than what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, in the stead thereof. Thus it is with many in the World. They pretend unto a <hi>strictness</hi> in some Duties, and a <hi>multiplication</hi> of others, at least unto a great Appearance thereof. But it is hard for any one to discover how that which they doe, belongeth to <hi>Evangelical Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> if its Nature depend on <hi>Evangelical Principles</hi> and <hi>Ends.</hi> Others fall from it <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>visibly,</hi> into a <hi>sinfull, worldly, flagitious</hi> Course of Life. This is that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> which the <hi>Christian World</hi> groans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this day, and which (as it is to be
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:204232:201"/> feared) will bring the <hi>Judgements</hi> of God upon it. The very <hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> is much <hi>lost,</hi> yea much <hi>derided</hi> amongst many. <hi>Duties</hi> of Holiness, <hi>Strictness</hi> of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Communication</hi> unto Edification, are not onely <hi>neglected,</hi> but <hi>scorned.</hi> It is in many places a <hi>lost labour</hi> to seek for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> among <hi>Christians;</hi> And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy seems to be increasing every day. It is the <hi>latter</hi> of these which I principally intend, as that which is of most <hi>universal</hi> Concernment. But the former also, though under many <hi>specious</hi> Pretences, being of no less <hi>pernicious</hi> Event unto many, must not be wholly passed by. I shall therefore first give some Instances of mens <hi>Declensions</hi> from the holy Wayes of <hi>Gospel Obedience,</hi> into Paths of <hi>pretended Duties</hi> of their own finding out, and adde those Reasons of their dislike of the <hi>Good Old Way,</hi> which gives them Occasion so to doe.</p>
               <p>The first and most signal Instance of this kind is given us by the <hi>Romanists.</hi> None boast more than they of <hi>Holiness,</hi> that is, of their Church, making its <hi>Sanctity</hi> a Note of its <hi>Truth.</hi> But because the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>flagitious</hi> Lives, not onely of the <hi>Body of the People</hi> among them, but of many of their chief <hi>Rulers and Guides,</hi> is openly manifest;
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:204232:202"/> in the defence of their confident Claim, as that alone which will give countenance unto it, they betake themselves unto their <hi>Votaryes,</hi> or those who dedicate themselves by <hi>Vow</hi> unto more strict Exercises in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than others attain or are obliged unto. And this sort of People have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained alone the Name and Reputation of <hi>Religious</hi> among them. What is their <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>manner of Life,</hi> what the <hi>Devotion</hi> wherein they spend their Hours, what the <hi>Duties</hi> they <hi>oblige</hi> themselves unto in great variety, and the <hi>manner</hi> wherein they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, I shall take for granted, and pass by as generally known. Many have already discovered the <hi>Vanity, Superstition</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> of the whole <hi>outward Course</hi> wherein they are generally ingaged, though they neither do nor ought to judge of the Hearts, Minds and State of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals,</hi> unless where by their <hi>Deeds</hi> they manifest themselves; I shall onely evince, that what at Best they pretend unto, (though boasted of not onely to be <hi>all,</hi> but <hi>more</hi> than God requireth of them,) is not that <hi>Holiness</hi> or Obedience which is prescribed unto us in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what substituted in the room of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently in Opposition unto it. And</p>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:204232:202"/>
               <p> First, It hath not that <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Freedom and Liberty</hi> which <hi>Gospel-Holiness</hi> in all the Duties of it is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed withall. The first Effect of its <hi>Truth</hi> upon our Minds, is, <hi>to make us free, Joh.</hi> 8. 32. It is the <hi>Principle</hi> of all Holiness, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth the Mind and Spirit unto it, whence it is called the <hi>Holiness of Truth, Ephes.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>So where the Spirit of God is, there is Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. Men are <hi>naturally</hi> the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Sin,</hi> willingly giving up themselves unto the fulfilling of its Lusts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and are <hi>free</hi> onely from <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> But where the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> worketh with the Word of <hi>Truth,</hi> men are made <hi>free from Sin, and become the Servants of God, having their Fruits unto Holiness, Rom.</hi> 6. 20, 22. So it is said of all <hi>Believers,</hi> that they have <hi>not received the Spirit of Bondage again unto Fear, but the Spirit of Adoption, whereby they cry Abba Father,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. <hi>Not a Spirit of Fear, but of Power and Love, and of a sound Mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 7. The Meaning of all these and the like Testimonies, is, that God by his <hi>Grace</hi> enlargeth, <hi>makes free</hi> and ready the Hearts of Believers unto all <hi>Gospel-Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> so as that they shall <hi>walk</hi> in it, and perform all the Duties of it <hi>willingly, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:204232:203"/>
                  <hi>freely,</hi> without that Fear and Dread which is an Effect of the Power of the Law. They are not in a <hi>scrupulous Bondage</hi> unto outward Duties and the Manner of their Performance, but do all things with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> and <hi>Freedom.</hi> They have by the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption</hi> as the <hi>reverential Fear</hi> of Children, so their Gracious <hi>Inclination</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Obedience. But in that Exercise of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> and multiplyed outward Duties of Religion which the <hi>Romanists</hi> boast of as their especial Sanctity, there are great Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of a Servile <hi>Bondage,</hi> or slavish Frame of <hi>Spirit.</hi> For they are forced to <hi>bind</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to be bound unto it by <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Vows,</hi> in whose Observation they no more act as their own Guardians, or as those who are <hi>sui Juris,</hi> but are under the coercive <hi>Discipline</hi> of others, and outward Punishment in case of Failure. And those who are so <hi>Servants of Men</hi> in Religious Duties are not <hi>Gods Free-men,</hi> nor have they Christ for their <hi>Lord</hi> in that Case, who have another. The Foundation of all these Duties, and which alone obligeth them unto their Performance, are <hi>Vows,</hi> no where required by God or our Lord Christ in the Gospel. And the principal Regard which any have in their <hi>strict At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance</hi>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:204232:203"/> unto them, is the <hi>Obedience</hi> which they owe unto the <hi>Super-Intendents</hi> of those Vows. It is easie to apprehend how inconsistent this Way is with that <hi>spiritual Freedom,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of Mind which inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably accompanyeth true <hi>Gospel-Holiness.</hi> Besides, the Opinion of <hi>Merit,</hi> which not onely goeth along with them, but also <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> them in all these Services, makes them <hi>servile</hi> in all they doe. For they cannot but know, that every thing in <hi>Merit</hi> must not onely be tryed by the Touch-stone of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> but weighed in the Ballance to the <hi>utmost scruple,</hi> to find out what it amounts or comes unto. And this is perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of that <hi>Liberty</hi> in Obedience which the Gospel requireth. So also is that tormenting Perswasion which they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of, namely, <hi>That they have no Grounds of Confidence or Assurance, that either they are accepted with God here, or shall come to the blessed Enjoyment of him hereafter.</hi> Hence in all Duties they must of Necessity be acted with a Spirit of <hi>Fear,</hi> and not of <hi>Power</hi> and a <hi>sound Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Rule</hi> of their <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> as to what is in their <hi>own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> Eminent therein, is not the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but a <hi>Systeme</hi> of peculiar <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> that they
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:204232:204"/> have framed for themselves. So some obey the Rule of <hi>Benedict,</hi> some of <hi>Francis,</hi> some of <hi>Dominic,</hi> some of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the like. This utterly casts out their <hi>whole Endeavour</hi> from any Interest in <hi>Gospel-Holiness;</hi> For the Formal Nature of that consists herein, that it is a <hi>Conformity</hi> unto the <hi>Rule of the Gospel</hi> as such, or a Complyance with the <hi>Will</hi> of God as manifested therein. Hence do they multiply <hi>unrequired Duties,</hi> yea, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts of their <hi>Devotion</hi> and Sanctity consist in <hi>them</hi> which are of their own <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising,</hi> for which they have no Gospel <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> or <hi>Command.</hi> And such in particular are those <hi>Vows</hi> which are the Foundation of all that they doe. In this Case our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Reproving the <hi>Pharisees</hi> for their additional Duties beyond the Prescript of the <hi>Word,</hi> shews them how they made <hi>the Commandment of God of none Effect by their Traditions,</hi> and that <hi>in vain</hi> they <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> God, <hi>teaching the Commandments</hi> of Men; <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 6, 9. And when they were offended at his Rejection of one of their new-imposed Duties; he replyes, That <hi>every Plant which his Heavenly Father hath not planted should be rooted up;</hi> ver. 13. So wholly rejecting all those Religious Duties which they had framed by Rules of their
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:204232:204"/>
                  <hi>own devising.</hi> Nor are these of the <hi>Roman</hi> Devotionists of any better Constitution; they are <hi>Plants</hi> of mens <hi>own planting,</hi> and shall be rooted up accordingly and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire. Let the <hi>Number</hi> of false invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Duties of Religion be never so <hi>great,</hi> let the <hi>Manner</hi> of their Performance be never so <hi>exact</hi> or <hi>severe,</hi> they serve to no other End but to <hi>divert</hi> the Minds of Men from the Obedience which the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is nothing in all that is <hi>prescribed</hi> by the <hi>Masters</hi> of this Devotion, or <hi>practised</hi> by the <hi>Disciples,</hi> but it may all be done and observed without either <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ, or a Sense of his <hi>Love</hi> unto our Souls. The Obedience of the Gospel is the <hi>Obedience of Faith;</hi> on that and no other <hi>root</hi> will it grow; And the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Motive unto it is the <hi>Love of Christ,</hi> which <hi>constraineth unto it.</hi> But what is there in all <hi>their Prescriptions</hi> that these things are necessary unto? May not men rise at Midnight to repeat a Number of Prayers, or goe Bare-foot, or wear Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, or abstain from Flesh at certain Times or alwayes, submit to Discipline from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or others, and (if they have bodily Strength to enable them,) undergoe all the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:204232:205"/>
                  <hi>horrid</hi> (and indeed <hi>ridiculous)</hi> Hardships of <hi>standing on a Pillar</hi> continually, or <hi>bearing</hi> great <hi>loggs of Wood</hi> on their Shoulders all the day long, that are told or fabled of the <hi>Egyptian Monks,</hi> without the least Dram of saving <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Love?</hi> All <hi>false</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have ever had some amongst them who have had an Ambition to amuze others with these <hi>self-afflictions</hi> and <hi>macerations,</hi> wherein the Devotions among the <hi>Banni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> do exceed at this day whatever the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> pretend unto.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>whole</hi> of what they doe, is so <hi>vitiated</hi> and <hi>corrupted</hi> with the proud Opinion of <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Supererrogation,</hi> as renders it utterly <hi>forreign</hi> unto the <hi>Gospel.</hi> It is not my present Business to <hi>dispute</hi> against those Opinions. It hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready abundantly manifested, (and may be yet so again where it is necessary,) that they wholly <hi>enervate</hi> the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> are <hi>injurious</hi> to the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Mediation</hi> of Christ, and are utterly inconsistent with the <hi>fundamental Principles</hi> of the Gospel. Whereas therefore these proud Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do animate their whole Course of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Gospel is not concerned in what they doe.</p>
               <p>And we may adde unto what hath been
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:204232:205"/> remarked already, the Consideration of that <hi>gross Superstition,</hi> yea and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which they give up themselves unto, almost in most of their Devotions. This is not the least of their Transgressions in these things, but is sufficient to <hi>violate</hi> all they doe besides. Wherefore, notwithstanding their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence unto <hi>Sanctity,</hi> and a more strict At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance unto Duties of Obedience than other men; yet it is manifest, that the Best of them are under a <hi>Defection</hi> from the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the Gospel, substituting an Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto their own Imaginations in the room thereof.</p>
               <p>Again, Others confine the <hi>whole</hi> of their Obedience unto <hi>Morality,</hi> and <hi>deride</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is pleaded as <hi>above</hi> it and <hi>beyond</hi> it under the Name of <hi>Evangelical Grace,</hi> as <hi>Enthusiastical Folly.</hi> And the Truth is, if those Persons who plead for the Necessity of Gospel <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> which is more than so, do understand each other, and that somewhat of the same things are not intended by them under different Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and divers Methods of their Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are not of the same Religion. But if they mistake the Meaning of each other, and differ onely in the <hi>Manner of Teaching</hi> the same Truth, I suppose they
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:204232:206"/> steer the safest Course and freest from just Offence, who follow and comply with the <hi>Manner</hi> wherein the things intended are taught in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> rather than those who accommodate their Discourses unto the <hi>Phraseology</hi> of Heathen Philosophers. But the Truth is, the Difference seems to be <hi>real,</hi> and the Principles men proceed upon in these things are <hi>contradictory</hi> to each other. For some do plainly affirm, that the <hi>whole</hi> of Gospel Obedience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the Observance of <hi>Moral Vertue,</hi> which they so describe as to render it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of <hi>Evangelical Grace.</hi> This others judge to contain an open <hi>Declension</hi> from, and waving of Gospel Holiness. It is granted freely, that the performance of all <hi>Moral Duties</hi> Evangelically, that is, in the Power of the Grace of Christ, unto the Glory of God by him, is an Essential part of Gospel Obedience. And whoever they are who (under the pretence of <hi>Grace,</hi> or any thing else,) do neglect the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> or the Observance of the Duties of Morality, they are so far disobedient unto the Gospel and the Law thereof. And some Men do not understand how contemptible they render themselves in the Management of their Cause, when
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:204232:206"/> they charge others with an Opposition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Morality,</hi> or <hi>Moral Vertue,</hi> and setting up they know not what <hi>imaginary Holiness</hi> in the room thereof. For, those whom they so calumniate, are not onely immediately discharged from any sense of Guilt herein, by the Testimony of their own Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but all other men, so far as the Rule of Ingenuity is extended, do from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>Practice,</hi> avouch their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
               <p>But is it not so then, that men do <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Morality</hi> as that which is not to be Trusted unto, but will deceive them that rest in or upon it? I answer, they do so, when it is made (as it is by some) the <hi>whole</hi> of Religion, and as it is obtruded into the place of Evangelical Grace and Holiness by others. They take <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> (as it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes was taken, untill of late) for <hi>natural Honesty,</hi> or such a Conformity of Life unto the Light of <hi>Nature,</hi> as to be usefull and approved among men. But this may be; Men may doe that which is <hi>morally Good,</hi> and yet never doe any thing that is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God. For they may doe it, but not for the Love of <hi>God</hi> above all, but for the Love of <hi>Self.</hi> And therefore <hi>they</hi> charge
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:204232:207"/>
                  <hi>Morality</hi> with an Insufficiency unto the Ends of Religion, or the saving of the Souls of Men;</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Where nothing is intended by it, but that whereof the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi> is the <hi>Light of Nature;</hi> For that doth direct unto every Duty that is properly <hi>Moral.</hi> And what it doth not direct unto, what is not Naturally by the Law of our <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> Obligatory unto all Mankind, cannot be called <hi>Moral.</hi> Now to confine all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as to the Preceptive and Obediential part of it, unto the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> is to Evacuate one half of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) Where it is in <hi>practice</hi> an Effect of <hi>Conviction</hi> onely, and performed in the <hi>innate strength</hi> of the Rational Faculties of our Souls, without the especial supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aid of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of God. Whatever Name any thing may be called by that is not wrought <hi>In us</hi> by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, as well as <hi>By us</hi> in a way of <hi>Duty,</hi> is foreign unto <hi>Evangelical Obedience.</hi> And those who reject <hi>Morality</hi> as insufficient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Acceptation with God and Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, intend onely what is of that kind performed in the Powers of our <hi>Natural Faculties</hi> externally excited and directed, without any supernatural Influence or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:204232:207"/> of <hi>especial Grace.</hi> And indeed so to place a Confidence in such Duties, is open <hi>Pelagianisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) Where it proceedeth not from the <hi>spiritual supernatural Renovation</hi> of our Souls. The Rule and Method of the Gospel is, that the <hi>Tree be first made Good,</hi> and then the <hi>Fruit</hi> will be so also. Unless a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be first <hi>Regenerate,</hi> and his <hi>Nature</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Renewed into the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeness</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> unless he be endued with a New Principle of <hi>spiritual Life</hi> from above, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling him to Live unto God, he can do nothing of whatsoever sort it be, that is absolutely <hi>acceptable</hi> unto God. And it is especially under this Consideration that any reject <hi>Morality,</hi> as not Comprehensive of <hi>Gospel Obedience;</hi> yea as that which is apt to draw off the Mind from it, and which will deceive them that trust to it; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it proceedeth not from the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> in a <hi>renewed Soul.</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth so, though it may be Originally of a <hi>Moral Nature</hi> in its self, yet from the Manner of its Performance it becomes <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> and Evangelical. And we need not fear to exclude the <hi>best</hi> Works of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed Persons from being any part of <hi>Gospel Holinesse</hi> or <hi>Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:204232:208"/> (4) Where those in whom it is, or who pretend unto it, are really destitute of the internal <hi>Light of saving Grace</hi> enabling them to discern <hi>spiritual things</hi> in a <hi>spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and to know the Mysteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. That there is such a <hi>saving Light</hi> wrought in the Minds of Believers by the Holy Ghost, that without it men cannot discern <hi>spiritual things,</hi> so as to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, like, and approve of them, hath been elsewhere at large demonstrated. But this belongs not unto the <hi>Morality</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about. It is not onely independent on it, but is indeed set up in competition with it, and opposition unto it. No man need fear to judge and censure that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> as unto its Interest in Gospel Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Sufficiency unto the Salvation of the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, which may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, practised and lived up unto, where God doth not <hi>shine into the Hearts of Men</hi> to give them the <hi>Knowledge of his Glory in the face of Jesus Christ;</hi> where no work of <hi>spiritual Illumination</hi> hath been in their <hi>minds</hi> enabling them to <hi>discern and know the Mind of God,</hi> which none knoweth Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>but the Spirit of God, by whom they are made known unto us;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Yet this is that which some Men seem to take up
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:204232:208"/> withall, and rest in, unto the Rejection of Evangelical Obedience.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The same <hi>Censure</hi> is to be passed on it, wherever it is separable from those Fundamental Gospel Graces which both in their Natures, Acts, and Objects are purely <hi>supernatural,</hi> having no Principle, Rule or Measure but <hi>Truth supernaturally revealed.</hi> Such in particular is the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we have unto the <hi>Mediation of Christ,</hi> as also the <hi>Dispensation</hi> of <hi>the Spirit</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to abide with the Church for ever as its <hi>Comforter,</hi> with all the Duties of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which depend thereon. He is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Gospel, that knows not that in these things do lye the <hi>fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of its Doctrine and Precepts, and that in the Exercise of those Graces in a way of Duty which immediately concerns them, consist the principal parts of the Life of God, or of that Obedience unto him by Jesus Christ, which is indispensibly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all that shall be saved. Whereas therefore these things cannot be esteemed meerly <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> nor do at all belong unto, but are considered as separate from all that <hi>Morality</hi> which is judged insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> it is evident that it is not in the least dealt withall too
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:204232:209"/> severely, nor censured more harshly than it doth deserve. If therefore any betake themselves, hereunto as to the <hi>whole</hi> of their Duty, it comes under the account of that <hi>partial Defection</hi> from the Gospel which we enquire into.</p>
               <p>Some there are who, as unto themselves, pretend they have attained unto <hi>Perfection</hi> already in this World; such a Perfection in all <hi>degrees of Holiness</hi> as the Gospel is but an Introduction towards. But this proud Imagination, destructive of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace,</hi> of all Use and Mediation of the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> contrary to innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Testimonies of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> of all that do Believe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which their own <hi>Consciences</hi> do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Pretenders unto it, needs not detain us in its Examination. It is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto our <hi>present Design</hi> to have given these Instances, How men may in a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Conscientious Discharge</hi> of many Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Obedience, yet <hi>fall off</hi> and <hi>decline</hi> from that which the Gospel requireth. The <hi>Occasions</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> hereof (supposing those more <hi>General</hi> before considered with respect unto the <hi>Truth of the Gospel,</hi> which all of them take place here, and have their Influence upon their Dislike of its <hi>Holiness,)</hi>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:204232:209"/> may be briefly enquired into, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented. Nor shall we confine our selves unto the Instances given, but take in the Consideration of every <hi>Declension</hi> from it, which on any Account befalls them who having had a <hi>Conviction</hi> of its <hi>Necessity,</hi> yet refuse to come unto its <hi>universal practice.</hi> And to this End we may observe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>Holiness</hi> which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel requireth, will not be <hi>kept up</hi> nor main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained either in the <hi>Hearts</hi> or <hi>Lives</hi> of men, without <hi>a continual Conflict,</hi> warring, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending; and that with all Care, Diligence, Watchfulness, and Perseverance therein. It is our <hi>Warfare,</hi> and the Scripture abounds in the Discovery of the <hi>Adversaries</hi> we have to Conflict withall, their Power and Subtilty, as also in Directions and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements unto their Resistance. To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that <hi>Gospel Obedience</hi> will be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Hearts and Lives without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Management of a <hi>vigorous Warfare</hi> against its Enemies, is to deny the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and the <hi>Experience</hi> of all that do Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and Obey God in Sincerity. <hi>Sathan, Sin,</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> are continually assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and seeking to ruine its <hi>Interest</hi> in us. The Devil will not be <hi>resisted,</hi> which it is our Duty to doe, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8, 9.) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:204232:210"/> a sharp <hi>Contest</hi> and <hi>Conflict;</hi> in the Management whereof we are commanded to <hi>take unto our selves the whole Armour of God; Ephes.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Fleshly Lusts</hi> do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually <hi>warre</hi> against our Souls, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. and if we maintain not a <hi>Warfare</hi> unto the End against them, they will be our <hi>ruine.</hi> Nor will the <hi>Power</hi> of the World be any otherwise avoided than by a <hi>Victory</hi> over it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. which will not be carryed without <hi>Contending.</hi> But I suppose it needs no great Confirmation unto any who know what it is to <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> God in <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> will not be <hi>preserved</hi> nor continued in, without a severe <hi>striving, labouring, contending, warring,</hi> with Diligence, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and Perseverance; So that I shall at present take it as a Principle (Notionally at least,) agreed upon by the Generality of Christians. If we like not to be <hi>Holy</hi> on these Terms, we must let it alone, for on any other we shall never be so. If we <hi>faint</hi> in this Course, if we give it over, if we think what we aim at herein not to be worth the obtaining or preserving by such a <hi>severe Contention</hi> all our dayes, we must be content to be without it. Nothing doth so promote the Interest of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:204232:210"/> in the World, as a Presumption that a <hi>lazy slothfull Performance</hi> of some <hi>Duties,</hi> and <hi>Abstinence</hi> from some <hi>Sins,</hi> is that which God will <hi>accept</hi> of as our <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> Crucifying of <hi>Sin,</hi> mortifying our <hi>inordinate Affections,</hi> contesting against the whole Interest of the <hi>Flesh, Sathan,</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> and that in <hi>inward</hi> Actings of Grace, and all Instances of <hi>outward</hi> Duties, and that <hi>alwayes</hi> while we live in this <hi>World,</hi> are required of us hereunto.</p>
               <p>Here lyes the <hi>first Spring</hi> of the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of many in the World, of them espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially who betake themselves unto, and take up Satisfaction in <hi>another Way</hi> of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than what the Gospel requireth. They had (it is possible) by their <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions</hi> made so near Approaches unto it, as to see what an <hi>uncessant Travail</hi> of Soul is required unto its Attainment and Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>They are like the <hi>Israelites</hi> travailing in the <hi>Wilderness</hi> towards the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> When they came neer unto the Borders and Entrance of it, they sent some to <hi>spy it out,</hi> that they might know the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>State</hi> of the Land and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey whither they were going. These for their Encouragement, and to evince the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:204232:211"/> Fruitfulness of the Earth, bring unto them <hi>a Branch with one Cluster of Grapes</hi> so Great and Fair that they <hi>bare it between two on a staffe,</hi> and <hi>they brought also Pomegranates and Figs; Numb.</hi> 13. 23. But withall, they told them of the <hi>hideous Difficulties</hi> they were to Conflict withall, in that the People were <hi>strong,</hi> their <hi>Cities walled,</hi> and the <hi>Anakims</hi> dwelling among them, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. This ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disheartens the <hi>carnal People,</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Prospect they had of the Land that <hi>flowed with Milk and Honey,</hi> back again they goe into the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> and there they perish.</p>
               <p>So it is with these Persons; Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the neer Approach they have made by <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Convictions</hi> unto the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> (as our Saviour told the <hi>Young Man</hi> who was as one of them; <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 34.) and the Prospect they have of the <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Holiness,</hi> yet turn off from it again and perish in the <hi>Wilderness.</hi> For upon the View they have of the Difficulties which lye in the Conflict mentioned, they fall under many Disadvantages which at length utterly divert them from its pursuit. As,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>Weariness of the Flesh,</hi> not enduring to comply with that constant Course of <hi>Duties</hi> continually returning upon it, which
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:204232:211"/> is required thereunto. Various Pleas will be made for an Exemption from them, at least in some <hi>troublesome Instances.</hi> And the carnal Mind will not want Pretences to countenance the Flesh in its <hi>Weariness.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one Duty after another is first <hi>omitted</hi> and then utterly <hi>foregone;</hi> Neglect of a vigorous Constancy in <hi>subduing the Body,</hi> and <hi>bringing of it into subjection,</hi> commended by the Apostle in his own <hi>Example,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. is with many the <hi>beginning</hi> of this kind of Apostasie. These things (I say) will oft-times fall out, that through the <hi>weariness</hi> and Aversation of the Flesh, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by various Pretences of the <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mind,</hi> sundry Duties will be omitted. But this is the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Trial</hi> of the Saints, here is the difference between <hi>sound Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> and those who are acted onely by <hi>Convictions.</hi> Those of the <hi>first</hi> sort will sooner or later (for the most part speedily) be <hi>humbled</hi> for such Omissions, and recover their former Diligence according to the Prayer of the Psalmist; <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. <hi>ult.</hi> But where this Ground is won by the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and men grow satisfied under the Loss of any Duty, it is an Evidence of a <hi>hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical back-sliding Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) When men are come unto the <hi>height</hi>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:204232:212"/> of their <hi>Convictions,</hi> and proceed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi> with its Lusts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Affections, (which have for a while been checked and mated by Light,) will insensibly <hi>prevail,</hi> and weary the <hi>Mind</hi> with Sollicitations for the Exercise of its old <hi>dominion.</hi> For the <hi>Spring</hi> of it being not dryed, the <hi>bitter Root</hi> of it being not digged up nor withered, it will not cease untill it hath <hi>broke down</hi> all the Bounds that were fixed unto it, and bear down <hi>Convictions</hi> with Force and Violence.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>true Way</hi> of making <hi>Application</hi> unto the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> for <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Supplyes of the Spirit,</hi> to bring them unto, or preserve them in a State of <hi>Gospel-Holiness,</hi> is of the same importance. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, to dream of being <hi>holy</hi> according unto the Mind of God, is to renounce the <hi>Gospel.</hi> We need not look farther for Mens <hi>Apostasie</hi> than this, if they are <hi>satisfied</hi> with such an Holiness, such an Obedience, as is not <hi>derived</hi> unto us by the <hi>Grace of Christ,</hi> nor <hi>wrought</hi> in us by the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> nor <hi>preserved</hi> in us by the <hi>Power of Christ.</hi> The <hi>Way</hi> hereof such Persons are alwayes <hi>ignorant</hi> of, and at length do openly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise.</hi> Yet may men as well <hi>see</hi> without the Sun or Light, or <hi>breathe</hi> without the Ayre,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:204232:212"/> or <hi>live</hi> without Natural Spirits, as engage into or abide in the practice of <hi>Gospel-Holiness</hi> without continual Applications unto <hi>Christ</hi> the Fountain of all Grace, for <hi>spiritual strength</hi> enabling them thereunto. The Way and Means hereof these Persons being <hi>ignorant</hi> of, and unacquainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the <hi>Holiness</hi> which the Gospel requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth becomes unto them a thing <hi>strange</hi> and burdensome, which therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert and refuse. If therefore it be true, that <hi>without Christ we can doe nothing;</hi> that in our Life unto God, <hi>he liveth in us,</hi> and Efficiently <hi>is our Life;</hi> if from him (as the <hi>Head)</hi> Nourishment is supplyed unto every <hi>living Member</hi> of the Body; if the <hi>Life</hi> which we lead <hi>be by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> and the onely Way of deriving these things and all Supplyes of <hi>spiritual Strength</hi> from him, be by the Exercise of <hi>Faith</hi> in him; it follows unavoidably that all those who are unacquainted with this Way, who know not how to make their <hi>Application</hi> unto him for this End and Purpose, can never persevere in a Pursuit of <hi>Gospel-Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</hi> So hath it fallen out and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with them concerning whom we speak; As <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> or of <hi>Christs being the End of the Law for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:204232:213"/>
                  <hi>unto them that do Believe,</hi> is the Reason why Men go about to <hi>establish a Righteousness of their own,</hi> and will not <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Righteousness of God;</hi> so <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of the <hi>Grace</hi> which is continually to be received from Christ in a way of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,</hi> that we may be <hi>holy</hi> with <hi>Gospel-Holiness,</hi> is the Reason why so many turn off from it, unto <hi>another kind</hi> of Holiness of their <hi>own framing,</hi> which <hi>yet is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> because it is none at all. But many are so far from <hi>endeavouring</hi> after, or <hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> in Gospel-Holiness on this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>continual Supplyes of Grace</hi> from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ to that End, as that they avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly <hi>despise</hi> all Holiness and Obedience springing from that Fountain, or growing on that Root; in which Case God will judge. In the mean time, I say, (and the matter is evident,) that one principal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why men turn off from it upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>Difficulties</hi> that attend it, and the <hi>Oppositions</hi> that are made unto it, is their <hi>Ʋnbelief</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> in the Way of <hi>making Application</hi> unto <hi>Christ</hi> by Faith, for Supplyes of spiritual Strength and Grace.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>Ʋnacquaintedness</hi> with the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Evangelical Repentance,</hi> is another
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:204232:213"/> Cause hereof. This is that <hi>Grace</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably carryeth the Souls of Believers tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all their Failings, Infirmities and Sins. Nor are they able to <hi>live to God one day</hi> without the constant Exercise of it. They find it as Necessary unto the Continuance of spiritual Life, as <hi>Faith</hi> it self. It is not only a <hi>Means</hi> of our Entrance into, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs <hi>essentially</hi> unto our Gospel-state and our Continuance therein. Hereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs that continual humble <hi>Self-abasement,</hi> from a Sense of the <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of God, with the <hi>disproportion</hi> of the Best of our Duties unto his Will, which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers <hi>live</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> in continually; And he that is not sensible of a gracious <hi>sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>usefulness</hi> therein, knows not what it is to <hi>walk with God.</hi> Hereby doth God administer several Encouragements unto our Souls to abide in our Way of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; notwithstanding the many Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and Despondencies we meet withall. In brief, take it away, and you overthrow <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> and all other Graces. Those therefore who are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Nature and Use of this <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> who can taste no spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Refreshment</hi> in all its Sorrows, who know nothing of it but <hi>legal Troubles,</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:204232:214"/> Fear and Distractions, will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Thoughts of living in the <hi>practice</hi> of it all their dayes, which yet is as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary unto <hi>Gospel-Holiness,</hi> as <hi>Faith</hi> it self. Men I say falling into this Condition, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all these <hi>Difficulties</hi> to Conflict with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and lying under these Disadvantages, if any thing will offer it self in the room of this Costly <hi>Holiness,</hi> they will readily embrace it. Hence, as some betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto a <hi>pretence of Morality,</hi> (which as unto many is a <hi>meer Pretence,</hi> and made use of onely to countenance themselves in a <hi>Neglect</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> of that Obedience which the Gospel openly requireth;) so others doe under other Expressions retreat unto the meer <hi>Duties of their own Light,</hi> and those as onely required therein, with some peculiar Reliefs unto the <hi>Flesh</hi> in what is <hi>burdensome</hi> unto it. As for Instance; There is nothing that the <hi>Flesh</hi> more riseth up in a Dislike of, and Opposition unto, than Constancy in the Duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, in Families, on all Occasions; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if attended unto in a <hi>spiritual Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> as the <hi>Gospel</hi> doth require. But in it <hi>self,</hi> and as to the <hi>substance</hi> of it, it is a Duty which the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> exacteth of us. But whereas this may prove <hi>burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:204232:214"/> to the <hi>Flesh,</hi> a Relief is borrowed from a Pretence of <hi>Gospel Light</hi> and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that men need not Pray at any time, unless their <hi>own Spirits</hi> or <hi>Light</hi> do previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously require it of them; which is to <hi>turn the Grace of God</hi> into an <hi>Occasion of sinning.</hi> By this Means some have gotten an <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> wherein for the most part it seems <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> to them whether they <hi>pray</hi> at any time or no. And other Instances of the like Kind might be given. Upon the whole matter, to <hi>free</hi> themselves from this State, so uneasie to Flesh and Blood, so contrary unto all the Imaginations of the carnal Mind, some men have betaken themselves unto <hi>another,</hi> wherein they have (or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have) no <hi>Conflict</hi> against Sin, nor to need any <hi>Application</hi> unto the Lord Christ for Supplyes of <hi>spiritual Strength,</hi> which belongs not unto that <hi>Holiness</hi> which the Gospel requires, and which God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
               <p>It may be said, that in some of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> before given, especially in that of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> there is an Appearance of a <hi>greater Conflict</hi> with, and more <hi>hardships</hi> put on the <hi>Flesh,</hi> than in any other way of Obedience that is pleaded for. And there is indeed such an <hi>Appearance,</hi> but it is no
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:204232:215"/> more. The Oppositions that arise against their <hi>Austerities,</hi> are from <hi>without,</hi> or from Nature as it is <hi>weak,</hi> but not as it is <hi>carnal.</hi> It is possible that <hi>Sin</hi> may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in what they do, neither in its <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> nor <hi>Reign;</hi> Yea so far as it is leavened by <hi>Superstition,</hi> it acts it self therein no less than it doth in others by <hi>fleshly Lusts.</hi> But it is an <hi>internal spiritual immediate</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position unto its <hi>Being</hi> and all its Actings, that it riseth up with such Rage against, as to <hi>weary</hi> those who have not that <hi>living Principle</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> whereto the Victory over it doth peculiarly appertain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> will not <hi>allow</hi> of, nor will <hi>consist</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>habitual</hi> Omission of any <hi>one Duty,</hi> or the Satisfaction of <hi>any one Lust</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> or of the <hi>Flesh.</hi> As we are in all Instances of <hi>Duty</hi> to be <hi>perfecting Holiness in the fear of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1; so <hi>no Provision is to be made for the Flesh, to fulfill the Lusts thereof. Rom.</hi> 13. 14. This is that which loseth it so many Friends in the World. Would it barter with the <hi>Flesh,</hi> would it give and take <hi>Allowances</hi> in any kind, or grant <hi>Indulgence</hi> unto any one Sin, Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes would have a <hi>kindness</hi> for it, which now bid it <hi>defiance.</hi> Every one would have
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:204232:215"/> an Exemption for that Sin which he <hi>likes best,</hi> and which is <hi>most suited</hi> to his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and carnal Interests. And this would be Virtually <hi>a Dispensation</hi> for all Unholiness whatever. But these are the Terms of the <hi>Gospel;</hi> no one Duty is to be <hi>neglected,</hi> no one Sin is to be <hi>indulged,</hi> and they are looked upon as <hi>intolerable. Naaman</hi> would not give up himself unto the <hi>Worship</hi> of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> but with this Reserve, That he might also <hi>bow in the House of Rimmon,</hi> whereon his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Preferment</hi> did depend. <hi>Many things</hi> the <hi>Young Man</hi> in the Gospel boasted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to have done, and was (doubtless) wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to continue in the Performance of them; But yet through his whole Course, <hi>the Love of the World</hi> had the <hi>Prevalency</hi> in him, and when he was <hi>tryed</hi> in that Instance, rather than relinquish <hi>it,</hi> he gave up the <hi>whole.</hi> But this is the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> Although it provide a <hi>mercifull Relief</hi> against those daily Sins which we are <hi>overtaken withall</hi> by our Frailty and Weakness, or <hi>surprized</hi> into by the Power of Temptations, against the Bent of our Minds and habitual Inclination of our Wills, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2.) yet it alloweth not the Cherishing or Practice of <hi>any one Sin,</hi>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:204232:216"/> Internal or External whatever. An <hi>habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Course</hi> in any Sin, is utterly inconsistent with <hi>Evangelical Obedience,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9. Yea it requireth indispensibly that we be engaged in our Minds and Wills, in an Opposition unto <hi>all Sin,</hi> and a constant Endeavour after its <hi>not being</hi> in us, either in the <hi>Root</hi> or in the <hi>Fruit</hi> thereof. It will not <hi>connive</hi> at, or <hi>comply</hi> with any inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Affection, any habitual sinfull Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, nor the first Motions of Sin that are in the Flesh. This is that <hi>Perfection</hi> which is required in the <hi>New Covenant, Gen.</hi> 17. 1. that <hi>Sincerity, Integrity, freedom from Guile, walking after the Spirit and not after the Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Newness of Life,</hi> which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel every where prescribeth unto us. On no other Terms but <hi>Ʋniversality</hi> in <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>Opposition</hi> unto <hi>Sin,</hi> will it approve of us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>And this occasioneth the <hi>turning aside</hi> of many from the Pursuit of an Endeavour to be <hi>holy</hi> according unto the Rule of the Gospel. When by their <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> they come to take a view of what is required thereunto, it disliketh them, they cannot bear it, and therefore either at <hi>once</hi> or <hi>gradually</hi> give over all Wayes of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing their first Design. And men break
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:204232:216"/> with the <hi>Gospel</hi> on this Account, by the Means ensuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They cannot make the <hi>same judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin</hi> that the <hi>Gospel</hi> doth, nor will judge all those things to be Sin and Evil which the Gospel declares so to be. Yea we have some come unto that <hi>Pharisaisme,</hi> that they scarce think any thing to be <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> or worth taking notice of, unless it be openly <hi>flagitious.</hi> Under this Darkness and Ignorance all sorts of <hi>filthy noysome Lusts</hi> may be cherished in the Hearts of Men, keeping them at as great and real a Distance from the <hi>Holiness of Truth,</hi> as the <hi>most outragious outward Sins</hi> can doe. And this Neglect or Refusal to comply with the Rule of the Gospel before laid down, is grounded in and promoted by two Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have <hi>a willing Insensibility</hi> of the Guilt of some <hi>unmortified Lust,</hi> this they will abide in and cherish. For their Minds being <hi>habituated</hi> unto it, they find <hi>no great evil</hi> in it, nor do see any cogent Reason why they should foregoe it. So was it with the <hi>Young Man</hi> with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Love of the World.</hi> He was sorry that he could not be <hi>Evangelically</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent whilest he retained it; but seeing that
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:204232:217"/> would not be, he did not discern any such Evil in, nor was sensible of any such Guilt from it, nor could apprehend any such Equality in, or Necessity of <hi>Gospel-Holiness,</hi> that he should renounce the one for the embracing of the other. So will it be when any Lust is made <hi>familiar</hi> unto the Mind; it will not be <hi>terrified</hi> with it, nor can see any great <hi>danger</hi> in it. It is between such a <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> as it is between the <hi>Devil</hi> and the <hi>Witch,</hi> or one that hath a <hi>familiar Spirit,</hi> as we render the <hi>Hebrew Ob</hi> and <hi>Jideoni.</hi> At the first Appearance of the Devil, be it in what Shape it will, it cannot but bring a <hi>Tremor</hi> and Fear on Humane Nature. But after a while he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>familiar,</hi> and when alone he is to be <hi>feared,</hi> he is not <hi>feared at all.</hi> The poor deceived Wretch then thinks him in his Power, so that he can use or command him as he sees good; whereas he himself is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely in the Power of the Devil. Men may be <hi>startled</hi> with Sin in its first Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, on their first <hi>Convictions,</hi> or its first dangerous <hi>Efforts;</hi> but when it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their <hi>Familiar,</hi> they suppose it a thing in their <hi>own Power,</hi> which they can use or not use as they see Occasion; though indeed themselves are the <hi>servants of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:204232:217"/> being <hi>overcome</hi> thereby and brought into Bondage. Hence it is inconceivable how little sense of Guilt in some Sins men find, after they are <hi>habituated</hi> unto them. In <hi>some sins</hi> I say, for with respect unto <hi>Sins absolutely</hi> against the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science will not easily be bribed not to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> them. It will not in such Cases be <hi>speechless,</hi> untill it be seared and made <hi>sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi> But there are Sins not accompanyed with so <hi>great an Evidence,</hi> yet attended with <hi>no less Guilt</hi> than those which direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly militate against the <hi>Light of Nature.</hi> In this Case, when the Word of the <hi>Gospel</hi> comes, as it is <hi>living</hi> and <hi>powerfull, sharper than any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of the Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Marrow,</hi> as a <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer and Judge of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart;</hi> When it comes and discovers the secret Frames, Figments, Imaginations, Inclinations of the Mind, and condemneth what is in the least Measure or Manner <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular;</hi> when it will not be put off, nor accept of any Composition or Compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the most <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>rigid Profession</hi> in other things; Men are ready to <hi>withdraw</hi> themselves to the Rule of their own <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> which they find more <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>tractable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:204232:218"/> 2. A <hi>Dereliction</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> on this Account with respect unto the <hi>inwardness, spirituality</hi> and <hi>extent</hi> of its <hi>Commands,</hi> is much increased under the Influence of <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Opinions.</hi> And of this Nature are all those which tend unto the <hi>Extenuation</hi> of <hi>Sin.</hi> For some there are who suppose that there is not such a <hi>provoking Guilt,</hi> such a <hi>spiritual Outrage</hi> in Sin, as others pretend. Hence multitudes, as they judge, are <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely</hi> troubled and perplexed about it. A <hi>generous Mind</hi> free from superstitious Fears, and dark Conceits imbibed in <hi>Education,</hi> will deliver the Mind of Man from the trouble of such Apprehensions. A <hi>great sense</hi> of the Guilt of <hi>small Sins,</hi> is an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to promote the Interest of <hi>Preachers,</hi> and those who pretend to the Conduct of <hi>Conscience.</hi> The <hi>Filth</hi> and <hi>Pollution</hi> of Sin, is a <hi>Metaphor</hi> which <hi>few</hi> can understand, and <hi>none</hi> ought to be concerned in. That the <hi>Power</hi> of the Remainder of <hi>In-dwelling Sin</hi> is a <hi>foolish Notion;</hi> and that the <hi>disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Frames</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the <hi>Mind,</hi> through Darkness, Deadness, spiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition, or other secret Irregularities, are <hi>Fancies,</hi> not <hi>Sins,</hi> which we need not be troubled at our selves, nor make any Acknowledgement of unto God. These
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:204232:218"/> and the like Opinions are the <hi>Pharisaical Corban</hi> of our Age, corrupting the <hi>whole Law</hi> of our <hi>Obedience.</hi> And it were easie to manifest, how <hi>perillous</hi> and <hi>ruinous</hi> they are unto the Souls of Men; what <hi>powerful Instruments</hi> in the hand of Sathan to eclipse the Glory of the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> on the one hand, and to promote <hi>Apostasie</hi> from <hi>Holiness</hi> in the Hearts and Lives of men on the other. I shall onely say, set the corrupt Heart of Man by any Means <hi>at Liberty</hi> from an Awe and Reverence of the <hi>Holiness</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Law,</hi> with respect unto the <hi>inward</hi> Actings and Frames of the Soul, with a sense of Guilt where they are <hi>irregular,</hi> and a Necessity of constant <hi>Humiliation</hi> before God thereon, and an equally constant <hi>Application</hi> of it self unto the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> for Grace and Mercy; and it is <hi>wholly in vain</hi> to think of fixing any other Bounds unto the <hi>progress</hi> of <hi>Sin.</hi> The Ignorance hereof is that which hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in some the proud Imagination of <hi>Perfection,</hi> where they are far enough from bringing their Consciences and Lives to the <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but onely aggravate their Guilt by attempting to bend that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible Rule</hi> unto their own perverse and <hi>crooked Minds.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> In this Case, <hi>carnal Interest,</hi> which takes in and comprizeth all the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> of Men, calls for an <hi>Indulgence</hi> unto some <hi>one Sin</hi> or other, which the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> will not admit of. Pride and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Covetousness or Love of this present evil World, and the perishing things of it, Uncleanness or Sensuality in Eating, Drinking; Self-exaltation and Boasting, Vain-glory, Idleness, one or other must be spared. One thing (I say) or other on the Account of <hi>carnal Interest,</hi> either because <hi>small,</hi> or <hi>useful,</hi> or <hi>general,</hi> or suited unto a <hi>Natural Temper,</hi> or as is supposed made <hi>necessary</hi> by the Occasions of Life, must be reserved. Where this Resolution prevails, as men are absolutely excluded from any real Interest in <hi>Gospel-Holiness,</hi> which will admit of no such Reserves, so it will not fail to lead them into open <hi>Apostasie</hi> of one kind or another. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Such Persons are <hi>unapproved of God</hi> in <hi>all that they doe,</hi> and so have no Ground for Expectation of his Blessing or Assistance. For the Allowance of the least Sin, is such an Impeachment of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> as casteth a man out of the compass of <hi>Covenant-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with God. This is that <hi>offending in One point</hi> which ruines a mans Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:204232:219"/> and renders him Guilty against the <hi>whole Law; Jam.</hi> 2. 10. Any one <hi>actual Sin</hi> makes a man guilty of the Curse of the <hi>whole Law,</hi> as it contains the Covenant of Works; and the willing Allowance of a mans self in any one Sin <hi>habitually,</hi> breaks the <hi>whole Law</hi> as it contains the Rule of our Obedience in the Covenant of Grace. And if in this <hi>disapproved Condition</hi> men meet with outward Prosperity in the World, their Danger will be encreased, as well as their Guilt aggravated. And the utmost Care of Professors is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this matter. For there seems to be among many an open Indulgence unto <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi> Disorders; which hazards their whole <hi>Covenant-Interest,</hi> and must fill them with Uncertainty in their own Minds. High time it is for all such Persons to shake off every weight, and the sin <hi>that doth so easily beset</hi> them, and to run with re-doubled Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence the remainder of the Race that is set before them.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) This <hi>Indulgence unto any one Sin,</hi> will make way in the Minds, Consciences and Affections of men for the Admission of <hi>other Sins</hi> also: It will be like <hi>a Thief</hi> that is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in an House, and onely waits an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to open the Doors unto his other
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:204232:220"/> Companions; To this end he watcheth for a Season of <hi>sleep</hi> and <hi>darkness,</hi> when there is none to observe his Actings. Let a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who thus alloweth himself to live in <hi>any sin,</hi> fall into Temptation whilest he is a little more than ordinary careless, his <hi>allowed Corruption</hi> shall open his Heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any other Sin that offers for Admission. <hi>Look not</hi> (saith the Wise-man) <hi>upon the Wine when it is red, when it giveth its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the Cup, when it moveth it self aright; Thine Eyes shall behold strange Women, and thine Heart shall utter perverse things;</hi> Prov. 23. 31, 33. One Sin liked and loved, will make way for any other. There is a Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Alliance between Sins of all sorts, and they agree in the same End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. Where any one is <hi>willingly</hi> entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, others will intrude themselves beyond all our Power of Resistance.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) It will <hi>divert the Soul</hi> from the <hi>Ʋse</hi> of <hi>those Means</hi> whereby all other Sins should be <hi>resisted,</hi> and thereby <hi>Apostasie</hi> be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</hi> For, there is no Means appointed or sanctified by God for the Resistance or Mortification of Sin, but it opposeth <hi>Sin as Sin,</hi> and consequently every thing that is so, and that <hi>because</hi> it is so. Wherefore, whoever <hi>willingly</hi> reserves any one Sin from
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:204232:220"/> the Efficacy of the Means God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for its Mortification, doth equally reserve <hi>all.</hi> And as those Means do lose their Power and Efficacy towards such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, so they will insensibly fall off from a Conscientious Attendance unto any of those Ways and Duties whereby Sin should be <hi>opposed</hi> and <hi>ruined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Many of those <hi>Graces</hi> in whose Exercise this <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally consist, are such as are <hi>of no Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> in the World. The greatest Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists that ever were, whether <hi>Pharisees</hi> or <hi>Philosophers,</hi> could never separate between their <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of Vertue on the one hand, and their own <hi>Honour, Glory</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> on the other. There was in them, as the <hi>Poet</hi> expresseth it in one Instance,</p>
               <q>—Amor Patriae, landum{que} immensa cupido.</q>
               <p>Hence they alwayes esteemed those Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues the most Excellent which had the best <hi>Acceptation</hi> and the greatest Vogue of Prayse among Men. And it seems to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in the <hi>Nature</hi> of Man, to have some kind of Desire to be <hi>approved</hi> in what men judge themselves to do well and Laudably. Neither is this Desire so evil in it self, but that it may be mannaged in subordination
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:204232:221"/> unto the Glory of God, which nothing that is absolutely Evil or in its own Nature, on any Considerations or Circumstances can be. But when at any time it swells in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Excess, and the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Leaven of <hi>being seen and praysed</hi> of men, puffeth it up, it is the worst Poyson that the Mind can be infected withall. In what degree soever it be admitted, in the same it <hi>alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates</hi> the Mind from <hi>Gospel-Holiness.</hi> And it doth so Effectually, I mean this <hi>Self-love,</hi> and love of the Prayse of <hi>others</hi> doth so, on the Reason mentioned; namely, that the Graces in whose Exercise it doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally consist, are of <hi>no Reputation</hi> in the World. Such are, Meekness, Gentleness, Self-denyal, Poverty of Spirit, Mourning for Sin, hungring and thirsting after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Mercy and Compassion, Purity of Heart, Openness and Simplicity of Spirit, Readiness to undergoe and forgive Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Zeal for God, Contempt of the World, Fear of Sin, Dread of Gods Judgement for Sin; and the like. These are those <hi>Adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Inner man of the Heart which with God are of great price.</hi> But as unto their <hi>Reputation</hi> in the World, <hi>Weaknesse, Softnesse of Nature, Superstitious Folly, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Hypocritical Preciseness,</hi> is the best
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:204232:221"/> Measure they meet withall. When men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to discern, that as unto this <hi>Holiness</hi> of the Gospel, its principal work lyes <hi>within doors,</hi> in the Heart and Mind, in the things that no Mortal Eye seeth, and few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend so much as in the Notion of them, and which in their outward Exercise meet with no good Entertainment in the World, they betake themselves unto and rest in those Duties which make a <hi>better Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and meet with <hi>better Acceptance.</hi> And many of them are such as in their proper place are <hi>diligently</hi> to be attended unto, provided they draw not off the Mind from an Attendance unto those <hi>despised Graces</hi> and their Exercise, wherein the Life of true Holiness doth consist. And it is well if we are all sufficiently aware of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of Sathan in this Matter. In the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of the General <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of Christian Religion, to countenance all sorts of Persons in a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the <hi>principal Graces</hi> of the Gospel, the <hi>Necessity of Regeneration</hi> and an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Principle of <hi>spiritual Life,</hi> they were put wholly on Outward <hi>splendid Works</hi> of Piety and Charity, as they were esteemed. Let their Minds be defiled, their Lusts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified, their Hearts unhumbled, their
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:204232:222"/> whole Souls unfurnished of spiritual and heavenly Graces, yet (as they would have it,) these outward Works should assuredly bring them all unto a blessed Immortality and Glory. But this <hi>face of the Covering,</hi> this Vail that was spread over many Nations, being now in many places (particularly among Us) <hi>rent and destroyed,</hi> both Wisdom and much Circumspection are required, that neither under a Pretence, nor under a real Endeavour after the inward <hi>spiritual Graces</hi> of Christ and their due Exercise, we do not countenance our selves in the Neglect of those <hi>outward Duties</hi> which are any way usefull unto the Glory of God, and the Good of Mankind. These are some of the Causes, and other there are of an alike Nature, from the powerfull Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereof upon their Minds, men have changed <hi>Gospel Holiness</hi> for <hi>other Wayes</hi> of Obedience, which also they give other Names unto.</p>

               <head type="sub">Apostasie into Profaneness and Sensuality of Life; the Causes and Occasions of it. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in Publick Teachers and Guides in Religion.</head>
               <p>THat which yet remaineth to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered under this Head of <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding from the Commands of the Gospel,</hi> and the Obedience required in them, is of a worse Kind, and of a more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Consequence. And this is that open Apostasie into <hi>Profaneness and Sensuality of Life,</hi> which the Generality of them who are called <hi>Christians</hi> are in most places of the World visibly fallen into. If any be otherwise minded, if they suppose and judge that the Wayes and Walkings of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of <hi>Churches</hi> and individual Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, of whole Nations that profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be so, are such as the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth and approveth of, they seem either to be ignorant of the <hi>true state</hi> of these
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:204232:223"/> things in the World, or to be highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious unto the Grace and Truth which came by Jesus Christ. To suppose that he by his Gospel giveth Countenance unto, or conniveth at, that Darkness, Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Sensuality, those bloody Contentions and Oppressions; in a word, all those fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and noxious Lusts which at this day have overwhelmed the Christian World, doth what he can to render and represent it, not onely <hi>useless,</hi> but extremely <hi>perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> unto Mankind. For they do say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, That by <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his Doctrine</hi> Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is given unto that Degeneracy in Wickedness, which <hi>Heathenisme</hi> would not allow, whereby the World is filled with Confusion, and in danger to be precipitated into Ruine. I shall therefore at present take it for granted, (with the highest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to give up that Concession when any tolerable Evidence shall be given to the contrary,) that there is among and in the <hi>Churches</hi> whereunto the <hi>generality</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> do reckon themselves to belong, a <hi>visible Apostasie</hi> from that Piety, Holiness and Righteousness, which the Gospel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably requireth in all the Disciples of Christ, and which the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did Earnestly follow and Eminently
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:204232:223"/> abound in. An Enquiry into the Means and Causes hereof, is that which now lyes before us. And that especial Instance which I shall alwayes regard, is the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which as it hath given the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Example of <hi>Apostasie</hi> in this Kind of any Church in the World; so whatever of the same Nature befalleth others, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently represented therein.</p>
               <p>The immediate <hi>internal</hi> Causes, (which are, as the Rise and Original of all Sins, so of those wherein this <hi>Apostasie</hi> doth consist, because they are not peculiar hereunto, but equally respect all sins at all times,) belong not unto our present Enquiry. By these Causes I intend in <hi>general,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of Nature, the Power and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness of Sin, Love of the World, the Profits, Honours and Pleasures of it, the Rage of the Flesh after the satisfaction of its sensual Lusts, with the Aversation of the Minds of Men from things Spiritual and Heavenly, as being <hi>alienated from the Life of God,</hi> through the Darkness and <hi>Ignorance that is in them.</hi> For, these and the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Affections being excited and acted by the crafty Influences of Sathan, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with Temptations, do incline, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and carry men into all manner of
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:204232:224"/> Wickedness with <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>greediness; Jam.</hi> 1. 14, 15. But whereas all these things in General respect equally <hi>all Times, Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> and <hi>Sins,</hi> and whereas it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Work of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel (those I mean, who understand their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, with the Account they must give of the Souls committed unto their Charge) to discover the Nature, detect the Deceit, and warn men of the Danger of these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Occasions of Sin <hi>within</hi> them and <hi>without</hi> them; I shall not need parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly here to insist upon them. It is the more publick <hi>external</hi> Means and Causes which have produced, furthered and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the Apostasie complained of, that we shall take under Consideration.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>Occasion</hi> hereof in all Ages hath been given by, or taken from the <hi>publick Teachers, Guides</hi> or Leaders of the People in the Matter of Religion. I intend them of all sorts, however called, styled, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, into what Forms or Orders soever they are cast by themselves or others. And I name them so at large, because it is known how variously they are multiplyed, especially in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where (as to these parts of the World,) this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie began, and by which it is principally
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:204232:224"/> promoted, and that by all sorts of them. These at all times have and must have an especial Influence into the <hi>Holiness</hi> or <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holiness</hi> of the People; yea, the Purity or Apostasie of the Church, as to <hi>outward Means,</hi> doth principally depend upon them, with the discharge of their Office and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In many things they succeed into the Room of the Priests of Old, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall under the Command and Rebuke given unto them; <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; <hi>O ye Priests, this Commandment is for you. If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give Glory unto my Name, saith the Lord of Hosts, I will even send a Curse upon you, and will curse your Blessings: Yea, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart. Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn Feasts, and one shall take you away with it. And ye shall know that I have sent this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto you, that my Covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord of Hosts. My Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was with him of Life and Peace, and I gave them to him for the Fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my Name. The Law of Truth was in his mouth, and Iniquity was not found in his lips: He</hi>
                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:204232:225"/>
                  <hi>walked with me in Peace and Equity, and did turn many away from Iniquity. For the Priests lips should keep Knowledge, and they should seek the Law at his mouth: For he is the Messenger of the Lord of Hosts. But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to stumble at the Law: Ye have corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of Hosts. Therefore have I also made you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and base before all the People, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as ye have not kept my wayes, but have been partial in the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That holy, humble, laborious <hi>Ministry,</hi> which Christ first instituted in the Church, was the great Means of Converting Men unto <hi>Evangelical Obedience,</hi> and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of them therein. This, their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, their Spirit, their Example, their Manner and Course of Life, their Prayers, Preaching, and entire Endeavour tended unto, and were blessed and prospered of God unto that purpose; Then were the Lives of Christians a <hi>Transcript</hi> of the Truth of the Gospel. But through the Degeneracy of the following Ages, those who succeeded them became Troubled <hi>Fountains,</hi> polluting and corrupting all the <hi>Streams</hi> of Christian Religion. It is no uneasie thing to observe, in the Course of
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:204232:225"/>
                  <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Records and Stories, how by various degrees the Leaders of the Church became <hi>corrupt,</hi> and did corrupt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, giving them in themselves an Example of Strises, Divisions, Ambition, Worldly-mindedness; and by their Negligence in Discharge of their Duty depriving them of the Means of being made better, by the Power of the Doctrine, and Commands of the Gospel. Under the Old Testament the Priests and Prophets led the People into a double <hi>Apostasie.</hi> First into that of <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry; Jer.</hi> 23. 15. And this continued prevailing among them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till their Sin issued in a desolating Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This was the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, wherein all their <hi>Idols</hi> were buried in the Land of <hi>Shinar; Zach.</hi> 5. 11. After the Return of the People from thence, when they would no more be inveigled into <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> whereof God designed that Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity for an effectual Cure, the same sort of Persons by Negligence, Ignorance, and their evil Example in Profaneness, turned them off from God and his Law. This was begun in the dayes of <hi>Malachi</hi> the last of the Prophets, and ended in the <hi>total Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> and <hi>Destruction</hi> of that Church and People. And when the whole came unto
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:204232:226"/> its last Issue in the Rejection of the Lord Christ the Son of God, the same sort of Persons, even the <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> led and even forced the Body of the People into that great Rebellion and Impenitency therein, as is evidently declared in the Gospel. And it is to be feared that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the like Nature hath fallen out among Christians also: The first Apostasie the Christian World fell into, was by <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> principally under the Conduct of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this (as it will alwayes be) was accompanyed with Wickedness of Life in all sorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Many Churches and Nations being delivered from this Abomination, it is well if (by the same means) they are not falling into that of a worldly sensual prophane <hi>Conversation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture is so full on this Subject, and the Nature of the thing it self is such, as seems to require a deep and thorough Consideration of it. But the Nature of <hi>my Design</hi> will not admit of Enlargements on any particular Head, for I intend onely to point at the chief Springs and Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Evil; and accordingly this part of our Subject must be onely briefly (as that preceding) treated on.</p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:204232:226"/>
               <p> What was before asserted in general, namely, That the <hi>Well-being of the Church depends on the right discharge of the Office of the Ministry,</hi> will I suppose be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all; and it is plainly declared by the Apostle; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 12, 13, 14, 15. In proportion thereunto it will thrive or decay. The Nature of this <hi>Office,</hi> the Ends of its Institution, the Works and Duties of it, with the universal Experience of all Ages and Places, do evince this Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beyond all Contradiction. If therefore those who undertake the Exercise of this <hi>Office</hi> do eminently and notoriously fail in the Performance and Discharge of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, especially if they do so <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> and in any <hi>long succession</hi> of time, it cannot be but that the People will be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and degenerate from the Rule of the Gospel. The <hi>Flocks</hi> will not be preserved where the <hi>Shepheards</hi> are negligent; and Fields will be over-run with Weeds, Thorns and Briars, if they be not duely tilled. I shall therefore in the First place call over some of those things which are indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably required in and of the <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of the Church, that it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in its Purity, and kept up unto its Duty in Evangelical Obedience. And I
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:204232:227"/> shall insist onely on those which all men will acknowledge to be <hi>such Duties,</hi> or which none who own the Gospel can or dare deny so to be.</p>
               <p>First, It is required of them that they keep <hi>pure and uncorrupted</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> especially that concerning the <hi>Holiness</hi> enjoyned in it, both as to its <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Causes, Motives</hi> and <hi>Ends.</hi> So of Old, the <hi>Priests lips</hi> were to preserve <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and the People were to <hi>seek the Law at his mouth.</hi> This was one main End for which the Lord Christ gave unto, and instituted the Office of the Ministry in the Church. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>And he gave some Apostles; and some Prophets; and some Evangelists; and some Pastors and Teachers: For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ: Till we all come in the Ʋnity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect Man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: That we henceforth be no more Children, tossed to and fro, and carryed about with every wind of Doctrine, by the sleight of Men, and cunning craftiness whereby they lye in wait to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: But speaking the Truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the</hi>

                  <hi>Head, even Christ.</hi> The Preservation of the Truth, the Declaration, Vindication and Defence of it, so as the Members of the Church, the Disciples of Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Charge, be neither through Weakness or Ignorance as <hi>Children,</hi> nor thorough the Delusions of Seducers <hi>turned off from it,</hi> or be unsettled in it, was one great End why the Lord Christ instituted this Office therein. And upon their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this Duty depends the Growth, the Obedience, the Edification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Body. And therefore doth the Apostle give this principally in Charge unto the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in his solemn giving of it up unto their Care and Inspection, when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was no more to come among them; <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28, 30. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your selves, and to all the Flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers, to feed the Church of God which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with his own Blood. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous Wolves enter in among you, not sparing the Flock. Also of your own selves shal men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</hi> As he hath a regard unto other things, so in an especial manner to the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:204232:228"/> Introduction of perverse and <hi>corrupt Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> contrary to the Truth wherein they had been instructed by him, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the whole <hi>Counsel of God</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> with his own <hi>Worship;</hi> ver. 27. This they were to do, by their carefull, faithfull, diligent Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Vindication and Defence of the Doctrine which they had received. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially doth he press this upon his beloved <hi>Timothy.</hi> He being for a season fixed in the Ministry of the Church, he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen out by the Wisdom of the Holy Ghost to be a Pattern and <hi>Example</hi> in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions given unto him, unto all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospel in succeeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This Charge is expressely committed unto him; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13, 14. <hi>I give thee charge, in the sight of God who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Pontius Pilate witnessed a good Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That thou keep this Commandment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot, unrebukeable, till the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> Ver. 20. <hi>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding prophane and vain Bablings, and Oppositions of Science falsely so called.</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 13, 14. <hi>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithfull, he cannot deny himself. Of these</hi>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:204232:228"/>
                  <hi>things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord, that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hearers.</hi> And what he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd in his own Person, that also he was directed to <hi>commit unto others</hi> with the same Charge, that the Truth of the Gospel might be preserved incorrupt in succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generations, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my Son, be strong in the Grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things thou hast heard of me among many Witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</hi> The <hi>vehemency</hi> of the Apostle in this Charge, and his <hi>pathetical</hi> Exhortations do sufficiently evince the Moment and Necessity of this Duty, as that without which the Church would not be continued to <hi>be the Ground and Pillar of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Three <hi>Repositories</hi> of Sacred Truth, or of the Truths of the Mystery of the Gospel; The <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Hearts</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi> and the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the present Age. In the first God preserveth them by his <hi>Providence,</hi> in the second by his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> in the last by way of an <hi>Ordinance</hi> or especial Institution for that End.</p>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:204232:229"/>
               <p> In the first Way they have been kept and shall be kept safe against all Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Hell</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of all things. And if this way might fail, we acknowledge that the others would doe so also, whatever some pretend of their <hi>Traditions</hi> and others of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Inspirations.</hi> And whilest this doth abide (as it shall alwayes doe,) the loss that may befall in the other wayes may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived. And so it hath been several times, when the Faith of the Church hath been <hi>recovered,</hi> and its Profession <hi>reformed</hi> by the Light and Knowledge derived afresh from the <hi>Scripture.</hi> This <hi>Fountain</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Truth shall never be dry, but men may alwayes draw sufficiently, yea abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly from it, whilest they use the Means appointed thereunto. But yet this alone will not secure the <hi>publick Interest</hi> of Truth and Holiness. There must be other Means also of Communicating what is contained therein unto the Minds and Consciences of men. And the Scripture it self doth both appoint and require a <hi>Ministry</hi> unto this End. Secondly, There may be a Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Truth derived from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for a season in the <hi>Minds of Men and Hearts of</hi> private <hi>Believers.</hi> So was it in
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:204232:229"/> the dayes of <hi>Elijah,</hi> when in a destitution of all outward Ministry <hi>seven thousand</hi> were preserved in Faith and the Fear of God, <hi>not bowing the Knee unto Baal,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 18. This the Holy Ghost is in especial manner promised and given unto them to to effect; <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16, 17, 26. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20, 21. For herein is the Promise accomplished, that <hi>they shall be all taught of God; Joh.</hi> 6. 45. which though it be not wholly without Means, yet it is such as doth not alwayes and in all things indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably depend thereon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 11. And unto this Work of the Spirit, preserving the Truth in the Minds and Hearts of true Believers, the Continuance of it in the World as to its <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Profession</hi> under great and general <hi>Apostasies,</hi> is to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. So I no way doubt but that during and under the <hi>Papal</hi> Defection, there were great Numbers in whose Hearts and Minds the principal Truths of the Gospel were preserved inviolate, so as that by virtue of them they lived unto God and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with him. But this way of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Truth is confined unto <hi>individual Persons,</hi> and as such onely are they concerned therein. As unto <hi>publick Profession</hi> and the Benefits thereof, all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:204232:230"/> Truth is committed unto the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the present Age, and on the due Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Office and Work it doth depend. The Imagination of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about keeping Sacred Truths in the hidden <hi>Cells</hi> of <hi>Tradition,</hi> or invisible <hi>phantastical</hi> Treasures, which requires nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Care nor Wisdom nor Honesty unto its Custody, but a meer pretence of <hi>Key</hi> to open it, was one Engine whereby both <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> were driven out of the World.</p>
               <p>These things are inseparable. <hi>Gospel-Truth</hi> is the onely Root whereon <hi>Gospel-Holiness</hi> will grow. If any Worm corrode, or any other corrupting Accident befall it, the Fruit will quickly fade and decay. It is impossible to maintain the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> where the <hi>Doctrine</hi> from whence it springs is unknown, corrupted or despised. And on the other side, where men are weary of <hi>Holiness,</hi> they will not long give Entertainment to the <hi>Truth.</hi> For as to their Desires and Affections, they will find it not onely <hi>useless</hi> but <hi>troublesome.</hi> Hence the <hi>great Opposition</hi> which is made at this day against many important Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, ariseth principally from the Dislike men have of the <hi>Holiness</hi> which they guide unto, and require.</p>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:204232:230"/>
               <p> Secondly, It is required of the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that they diligently <hi>instruct the People</hi> in the Knowledge of the <hi>whole Counsel of God,</hi> in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the Gospel, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Truth, that they may know and doe the Will of God. And this are they to doe by all the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Wayes</hi> that God hath <hi>appointed,</hi> pressing it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, together with Instructions on their Souls and Consciences for its practice. The End why <hi>Evangelical Truth</hi> is committed unto their Care, is not that they may keep it to themselves, so <hi>locking up the Key of Knowledge,</hi> but that they may communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it unto others and instruct them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And he who doth not desire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to communicate unto his Flock <hi>all things that are profitable for them,</hi> can have no Evidence in his own Mind that God hath called him to the Office of the <hi>Ministry.</hi> The Apostle proposing his own Example unto the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> affirms, That he had <hi>not shunned to declare unto them the whole Counsel of God;</hi> Act. 20. 27. And that he <hi>kept back nothing that was profitable unto them;</hi> ver. 20. Men begin to <hi>talk</hi> or <hi>write</hi> about Preaching on this or that Subject: Some (they say,) preach <hi>all about Christ and</hi>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:204232:231"/>
                  <hi>Grace, and Justification by the Imputation of Christs Righteousness;</hi> and the like: But They preach about <hi>Gods Attributes, Moral Duties, Obedience to Superiours,</hi> and things of that Nature. But whether this Fancy have more <hi>Folly</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi> in it, is not easie to determine. It is like those who make this Plea, do speak truely as to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. They preach of the things they express <hi>exclusively</hi> unto the others which they meddle not with at all. For if they do teach them, then is the Opposition they fansie between those Wayes of Preaching altogether vain. But that others doe preach the things ascribed unto them with a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of those other Doctrines which such Persons pretend to appropriate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as their Province, is a fond Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and to encrease the Vanity of it, the Distribution is made by some with a <hi>total Silence</hi> on all hands, both on their <hi>own</hi> which they <hi>extoll,</hi> and that of <hi>others</hi> which they <hi>condemn,</hi> of that which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought to be the principal Subject of all Preaching, namely, <hi>Jesus Christ and him crucifyed.</hi> But the Truth is, he who knows not that it is his Duty to declare unto the People, not this or that part of it, but the <hi>whole Counsel of God,</hi> and who is
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:204232:231"/> not endowed with some measure of <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> so as to discern what is <hi>usefull, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable</hi> and <hi>seasonable</hi> unto his Hearers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their spiritual States and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions do require; knows not what it is to be a Minister of Christ or his Gospel, a <hi>faithfull Steward</hi> of the Mysteries of God, nor is meet to take that Office upon him. And there are three things which <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Teachers, Leaders</hi> of the People are to attend unto in the Discharge of this principal part of their Office, in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Knowledge of the Truth committed to them,</hi> unto others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they are to do it with all <hi>Care, Diligence</hi> and <hi>Sedulity.</hi> How vehement is our Apostle in his Charge to this purpose. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his Kingdom; Preach the Word, be instant in season, out of season; reprove, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, exhort, with all Long-suffering and Doctrine.</hi> How ought these words to sound continually in the Ears of all Ministers who design to be Faithfull in the Discharge of their Duty? How ought the <hi>power</hi> of them to abide on their Hearts? Are they spoken alone unto <hi>Timothy?</hi> Or will the Souls of
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:204232:232"/> Men be preserved, edified, saved, <hi>now</hi> with less Pains, and at an easier Rate than <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly?</hi> It will appear at the last day, that <hi>others</hi> also have an Eternal Concernment herein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they labour with the <hi>utmost</hi> of their <hi>strength,</hi> even to <hi>Fatigation</hi> and <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness.</hi> All the Names whereby their Office and their Work are expressed in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> do include this kind of Labour. As they are to <hi>give themselves unto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Word; Act.</hi> 6. 4. that is, <hi>wholly and entirely</hi> in their utmost Endeavours, continually unto this Work; so are they enjoyned <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to labour to the utmost of the strength</hi> they have, therein. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 16. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. It is not Bodily Labour alone in the Dispensation of the Word (wherein there may be much Variety according unto the various Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dispositions or Tempers of men, and of acquired Gifts,) but that Earnestness and Intention of Spirit which will carry along with them the laborious pains of the whole Person, that I intend. The cold <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Pronunciation</hi> or <hi>Reading</hi> (as is the manner of some) a <hi>well-composed Oration</hi> doth not well express this <hi>Labouring in the Word and Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:204232:232"/> 3. That their <hi>whole Work</hi> and all their <hi>Endeavours</hi> therein be accompanyed with <hi>constant Prayer,</hi> that the <hi>Gospel</hi> in their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi> may <hi>run and be glorified,</hi> that the <hi>Word</hi> may prosper in the Hearts and Lives of the People. So the Apostle affirms that they would <hi>give themselves continually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Prayer and the Ministry of the Word; Act.</hi> 6. 4. That Ministration of the Word which is not accompanyed with <hi>continual Prayer</hi> for its Success, is not like to have any great Blessing goe along with it. As our Apostle calls God to witness of his <hi>frequent mention of them in his Prayers</hi> unto whom the Word was Preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9, 10; so he desireth the Prayers of others also, that his Work and Labour in the Ministry might be prosperous and successefull, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 18. For a Minister to Preach the Word without constant <hi>Prayer</hi> for its success, is a likely Means to cherish and strengthen se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret <hi>Atheisme</hi> in his own Heart, and very unlikely to work Holiness in the Lives of others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is in like manner required of them, that (so far as Humane Frailty will permit,) they doe in their <hi>Persons, Wayes</hi> and <hi>Walkings,</hi> or <hi>Conversations,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Discharge of all their <hi>Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:204232:233"/>
                  <hi>Duties,</hi> give a true <hi>Representation</hi> both of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they Preach, and of <hi>Him</hi> in whose Name they dispense it. What Meekness, Humility, Zeal for the Glory of God; what Moderation, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal and Readiness for the Cross; what Mortification of corrupt Affections and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Desires of Earthly things; what Contempt of the World; what Benignity, Condescension and Patience towards all men; what Evidences of Heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness are required hereunto, both the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declares, and the Nature of the thing it self makes apparent. What can any men Rationally believe, but that they who Preach <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> unto them, do declare that they have no other Effect or Tendency but what in themselves they express and represent unto them? There is a secret Language in the Ministry of men, that what they <hi>are</hi> and <hi>doe,</hi> is that which the <hi>Doctrine</hi> they Preach doth require, which their Hearers do <hi>understand,</hi> and are apt to <hi>believe.</hi> The very Philosophers saw that so it would be with respect unto them who publickly taught <hi>Philosophy.</hi> To which purpose the words of <hi>Thernistius</hi> are remarkable. <hi>Orat.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:204232:233"/> Whatever Vices most men observe in such Persons, they will not attribute them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their depraved Natures or inward Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, but unto the <hi>Philosophy</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. Hence it is enjoyned them, that in <hi>all things</hi> they <hi>shew themselves patterns of good Works. Tit.</hi> 2. 7. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Be thou</hi> (saith our Apostle unto his <hi>Timothy,) an Example unto Believers, in Word, in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. This is the Dignity, Honour and Preferment that the Lord Christ calls his <hi>Ministers</hi> unto, namely, that they should in their own Persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present his <hi>Graces</hi> and the Holiness of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> unto others. Those who are otherwise minded, whose Designs and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections look another way, will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to fall under the Effects of a great Mistake. I do not reflect any thing upon what <hi>outward, secular, circumstantial</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages men may have in this World: But I do say, whatever they have of that Kind, which doth not enable them the more effectually in their Course and Work to express the <hi>Meekness, Humility, Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal,</hi>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:204232:234"/> and <hi>Zeal</hi> of Christ, with the <hi>Holiness</hi> of the Doctrine they teach, or should so doe, it will not redound unto any great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; It is also incumbent on them to <hi>attend</hi> with Diligence unto that <hi>Rule</hi> and Holy <hi>Discipline</hi> which the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> hath appointed for the <hi>Edification</hi> of the Church, and the Preservation of it in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Holiness and Obedience. This indeed most pretend a Readiness to comply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as that which is condited unto their Appetite by an Appearance of Authority and Power, which seldom are unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with other desireable Advantages. I shall onely say, it will be well for them by whom they are Administred according to the mind of Christ; but, that more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth thereunto than is usually appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended so to doe, I suppose few sober and intelligent Persons will deny.</p>
               <p>That these things, yea and many others of the like Kind, with all those Duties which are subservient or any way necessary unto them, are required of all <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel, <hi>Teachers, Guides, Rulers</hi> of the Church, and that <hi>constantly</hi> to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto with Zeal to the Glory of God and Compassion for the Souls of Men,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:204232:234"/> none (I suppose) who profess themselves <hi>Christians</hi> will in General deny. And if in these things the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the Ministry (whereon the Purity and Holiness of the Church depend) do consist, where they are wanting it is Morally impossible but that the <hi>generality of the People</hi> will gradually degenerate into Ignorance, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness, Immorality and Unholiness of every Kind.</p>
               <p>There is nothing I could more desire, than that the present Defection from <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Holiness</hi> which is so Visible in the World, might neither in <hi>whole</hi> nor in <hi>part</hi> be charged on a <hi>Defect</hi> in these things among this sort of men; yea that it might not be so unto Qualifications, Principles, and Actings directly contrary unto what is thus required. For if it be not so, there will be yet hopes of a <hi>Stay</hi> to be put unto its Progress, yea of an <hi>Healing</hi> and <hi>Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> from it. But I shall a little enquire into that which offers it self unto the view of all, premising these two things. (1) That I do not intend the Ministry of any one <hi>Place,</hi> or <hi>Nation,</hi> or <hi>Age,</hi> or <hi>Time</hi> more than another, but shall speak Indefinitely unto what hath been and is in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World. (2) That if indeed upon Trial
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:204232:235"/> none be found <hi>blame-worthy,</hi> none <hi>defective</hi> in these things, there is no Harm done, in that any are warned what to avoid. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Have they all <hi>kept the Truth</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Gospel, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Ministers</hi> thereof? (1) Are there not many of this sort who are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>wofully Ignorant of the Counsel of God</hi> revealed therein? Nay, are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who have neither <hi>Will</hi> nor <hi>Ability</hi> to search into the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Christ, and do therefore <hi>despise</hi> them? Can men keep in a way of Duty what they <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had,</hi> nor ever used those Means for the attaining of it, without which it will not be so done? And is it not manifest what must needs be, and what really are the Effects and Fruits hereof? Do not hereon Multitudes <hi>perish for want of Knowledge,</hi> and continue in the wayes of Sin because they have none to teach them better, at least not to teach them on such Principles as are alone effectual unto their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Holiness? They must <hi>dye,</hi> they shall <hi>dye in their Sins,</hi> but the Blood of their Souls will be required at other hands. For all the Causes of <hi>Gospel-Holiness,</hi> all proper Motives unto it, all effectual Ways
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:204232:235"/> and Means of Attaining it are hid from them.</p>
               <p>It is known how <hi>brutishly Ignorant</hi> the Generality of their Priests are in the <hi>Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> neither, for the most part, do the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of that Church require any more of them, than that they have skill enough to <hi>read</hi> and manage their publick <hi>Offices of Devotion.</hi> Neither is it much otherwise in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church in any of the Branches of it, whereby whole Nations, under a publick Profession of Christianity, are thorough stupid Ignorance degenerated into a prophane Course of Life, no less vile than that of the <hi>Heathens.</hi> It is well if it be not so in some measure in other places also. But the Truth is, the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of many who take upon them the Office of the Ministry, and their <hi>unconscionable Idleness</hi> when they have so done, is the great Occasion of the Continuance of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness</hi> and <hi>Ʋngodliness</hi> among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And if the <hi>Preaching of the Gospel</hi> be the onely Sovereign effectual Means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God for the Change of Mens <hi>Natures,</hi> and the Reformation of their <hi>Lives,</hi> (a Denyal whereof includes a Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Christianity,)</hi> it is a vain Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that either of them will be wrought
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:204232:236"/> in such a way as to restore the <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of Religion in the World, unless Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision be made for an <hi>able Ministry</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the Body of the People through all their Distributions in Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the Duty of this sort of Persons unto the same End, to <hi>preserve the Truth pure and uncorrupted.</hi> Unless this be done carefully and effectually, <hi>Holiness</hi> will not be maintained or preserved in the World. And it is evident how many of them have acquitted themselves herein, as hath been in part declared in the foregoing Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of the Gospel. By them it hath been, principally, <hi>debased, corrupted, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> and continueth yet so to be. Neither is there at this day scarce any one Doctrine that should really promote <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience,</hi> which is free from being <hi>despised</hi> or <hi>depraved</hi> by some of them. But this is not that which we now speak unto, it hath been done already. Our present Enquiry is after that <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> of, that <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Truth, which are eminently required of them. Do they <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>labour,</hi> and <hi>plead</hi> with God and Man for its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, as that wherein their <hi>principal</hi>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:204232:236"/>
                  <hi>Interest</hi> doth lye? Or do many esteem of it any further but as their <hi>outward</hi> Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages are secured by it? A <hi>Fault</hi> there is in this matter, and it is not without the especial Guilt of some that the World is come to such an <hi>Indifferency</hi> about the <hi>principal Truths</hi> of the Gospel, that from thence men slip into <hi>Atheisme</hi> every day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither are these Defects supplyed by <hi>Diligence</hi> in their <hi>Work;</hi> Yea the <hi>want</hi> thereof is of all other Evils in this Kind most <hi>evident.</hi> No words are sufficient to express the <hi>sloth</hi> and <hi>negligence,</hi> the <hi>cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>carelesness</hi> that are found amongst many in the Discharge of their Duty, as to the Instruction of others, and the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the Word of God to the Hearts and Consciences of Men. I shall not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>particular Instances,</hi> that none may be offended. The <hi>Matter</hi> it self is evident, and the <hi>Effects</hi> of it manifest. It may seem to some desireable that such things should be concealed; but whilest by reason hereof the <hi>Souls</hi> of Multitudes are in danger of <hi>Eternal Ruine</hi> every day, those who are sensible of their <hi>Misery</hi> may be allowed to complain. How few therefore do diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and industriously lay out themselves and their Strength in the Ministry with
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:204232:237"/>
                  <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Glory of God, and <hi>Compassion</hi> unto the Souls of Men? How few do take heed to themselves and to the Flocks, do watch and pray, and press their Message on the <hi>Consciences</hi> of their Hearers? Alas! it is but <hi>little</hi> of saving <hi>Truth</hi> that many know in the <hi>Notions</hi> of it, <hi>less</hi> they care to communicate unto others, because they know it not in its <hi>power.</hi> Will the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men be brought into the Obedience of Faith; will the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> in them be cast down and destroyed; will <hi>Gospel-Obedience</hi> be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the <hi>Lives</hi> of Men by such weak and Languid Endeavours as many satisfie themselves withall? If it be so, <hi>Conversion</hi> unto God, and the <hi>Fruits of Holiness,</hi> must be looked on as most easie things, and the <hi>Ministry</hi> it self to be of little use in the World. Certainly, there is another Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of these things in the <hi>Scripture;</hi> And notwithstanding the Growth of some Opinions that would render the whole work of <hi>Christianity</hi> so easie and facile as to be accommodated unto a <hi>negligent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi> yet the Event thereof is openly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. Wherefore, we need not fear to say, that <hi>coldness, lukewarmness, sloth</hi> and <hi>negligence,</hi> especially when accompanyed
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:204232:237"/> with <hi>Ignorance</hi> and spiritual <hi>Darkness</hi> about the principal <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Gospel, with an Inconcernment of <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> in the <hi>Importance, End</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of their Work, among them who are looked on as the <hi>publick Teachers</hi> of the Church at any Time, or in any Place, keeps open a <hi>wide Door</hi> for the <hi>Lusts</hi> of men to pour forth themselves into that Deluge of <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the <hi>Power</hi> of Godliness, which the World is even overwhelmed withall.</p>
               <p>So was it with the Church under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> as God by the Prophets complains in an hundred places. Can any man be so stupid as to imagine, that the Ordinary Discharge of the <hi>Priestly Office</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in saying their <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> at <hi>Canonical</hi> Hours, <hi>hearing of Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>giving Absolutions,</hi> without the least Dram of <hi>labouring in Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> is a Means to keep up the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> or is not an Effectual Means to drench Mankind in Sin and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity? Neither doth the calling of things by other <hi>Names,</hi> change their <hi>Natures.</hi> Wherever there is the same Neglect of the true Work of the <hi>Ministry,</hi> in the <hi>matter</hi> of it, or <hi>manner</hi> of its Performance, the same Event will ensue thereon. And it
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:204232:238"/> will be no where more <hi>fatal</hi> than where Men <hi>love to have it so,</hi> and <hi>despise</hi> whatever is spoken to the contrary, so as that it shall be esteemed a <hi>Crime</hi> for any one to be dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the soul-ruining Sloth and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of this sort of Men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, whereas great <hi>Relief</hi> in all these Cases might be taken from an <hi>holy exemplary Conversation</hi> and walking, among them in whom it is required as an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God for the <hi>Direction</hi> and <hi>Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi> of the People, it is manifest in the World, and sufficiently taken notice of, that many of them in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are openly <hi>ambitious,</hi> insatiably <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, proud, sensual, haters</hi> of them that are Good, Companions of the <hi>worst</hi> of men, evidencing the <hi>depraved habits</hi> of their Minds in all signal Instances of Vice and Folly. He that shall consider what was the <hi>state,</hi> what were the <hi>Lives</hi> of the Apostles and first Preachers of the Gospel, with those who succeeded them for some Ages following, not meerly as to their <hi>outward</hi> Condition of Straights and Poverty, (which as it will be pleaded, was occasioned by the <hi>state</hi> of things then in the World,) but as to that <hi>Humility, Lowliness of Mind, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, Contempt of the World, Zeal for God,</hi>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:204232:238"/>
                  <hi>Purity of Life,</hi> which they prescribed unto others, and gave an <hi>Exemplification</hi> of in themselves; and then take a view of that <hi>universal Contradiction</hi> unto them and their <hi>Wayes</hi> which the <hi>Lives</hi> and Course of very many in the World do at this day openly expresse, he must conclude, that either all those things were <hi>needless</hi> in them as to the publick Interests of <hi>Christianity,</hi> or that they are unspeakably <hi>endammaged</hi> by those of some at present.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it cannot with any Modesty be denyed, but that by Reason of these and the like Miscarriages in the <hi>spiritual Guides</hi> of the People, that the Generality of Christians have been either led, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered insensibly to fall into the present <hi>Apostasie.</hi> When God shall be pleased to give unto the People who are called by his Name, in a more abundant manner <hi>Pastors after his own Heart, to feed them with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Ʋnderstanding,</hi> when he shall revive and increase an holy, humble, zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, self-denying, powerfull <hi>Ministry,</hi> by a more plentifull Effusion of his Spirit from above, then and not untill then may we hope to see the <hi>pristine Glory</hi> and Beauty of our Religion restored unto its <hi>primitive</hi> State and Condition.</p>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:204232:239"/>
               <p> Those who do yet judge, that matters among the common Professors of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> as to the Obedience of <hi>Faith,</hi> are in as good a Posture as they were at any time formerly, or as they need to be, who have no other Desire or Interest in them, but onely that they should not be better; may abide in their security without troubling themselves with these things. But for such as cannot but see that a <hi>Revolt</hi> or <hi>Defection</hi> from <hi>Gospel Obedience,</hi> is not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the World, but carried unto that height that it is ready to issue in <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Atheisme,</hi> it is time for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider under whose hand this hath fallen out, and be stirred up to put a stop unto its progress, before it be too late. Nor is it to be expected or fansied that there will be a <hi>Recovery</hi> of the People from <hi>ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness,</hi> or unto the <hi>holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> requireth, untill there be such a Change wrought in the <hi>Ministry,</hi> that the <hi>Word</hi> may be so dispensed, and such <hi>Examples</hi> given, as may be effectual unto that End. It is to cast the highest Contempt on the <hi>Office</hi> it self, to imagine that this <hi>Breach</hi> can be otherwise healed. For whereas this Declension is fallen out under the Conduct of the <hi>present Ministry</hi>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:204232:239"/> and that of the <hi>fore-going Ages,</hi> it is not to be thought that it will be retrived under the same Conduct; and to suppose that it can be done any other Way, that the World of professed <hi>Christians</hi> shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto <hi>holy Obedience</hi> by any other Means but the <hi>Ministerial Dispensation</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> is to render it a thing altogether <hi>useless.</hi> Here then must begin the Cure of that Lethargy in <hi>Sin</hi> that the World is fallen into, namely, in the Renovation of a powerfull <hi>Evangelical Ministry,</hi> or the due Discharge of that Office by them that are <hi>called</hi> thereunto, or possess the <hi>place</hi> of it, if ever it be effected unto any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in this World.</p>

               <head type="sub">Other Causes and Occasions of the Decay of Holiness.</head>
               <p>SEcondly; Multitudes are led into, and countenanced in the wayes of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness,</hi> freely indulging unto their Lusts and corrupt Affections; by a <hi>false appropriation of justifying Names and Titles unto them, in wayes of Sin and Wickedness.</hi> This was one principal Means of Old whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> were hardned in their <hi>Impieties</hi> and <hi>flagitious Lives.</hi> For when the Prophets told them of their <hi>Sins,</hi> and warned them of Gods approaching Judgements, they opposed that Out-cry unto their whole Ministry, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord, The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord are these;</hi> Say what you please, we are the onely Posterity of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the onely Church of God in the World. This Contest they mannaged with the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in an especial manner;
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:204232:240"/>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. he saith unto them in the Name of the Lord, <hi>Amend your wayes and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place,</hi> ver. 3. their Reply and Defence is, <hi>The Temple of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Prophet makes that severe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Will ye steal, murder and commit Adultery, and swear falsely, and burn Incense to Baal, and walk after other Gods whom you know not, and come and stand before me in this House which is called by my Name?</hi> Will you give up your selves unto all manner of <hi>wickedness,</hi> and countenance your selves therein by being a People unto whom the <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>Worship</hi> of it is appropriated? And this in like manner was the great Prejudice which the <hi>Baptist</hi> had to contend withall when he came to call them to Repentance. <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children they were, and by vertue of that Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had Right unto all the Priviledges of the Covenant made with him, whatever they were in themselves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 9. And it is evident in these Examples, that the nearer Churches or Persons are unto an utter Forfeiture of all their <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and <hi>Destruction</hi> it self for their Sins, the more ready they are to boast of and support themselves with their <hi>outward state,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:204232:241"/> nothing else to trust unto. But if Men were able to countenance themselves in their Sins on this pretense against that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Prophetical Ministry</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to discard them of it, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them unto the Necessity of <hi>Personal Holiness;</hi> how much more will they be able to shelter themselves under its shades, when they shall be <hi>taught</hi> so to doe?</p>
               <p>When Men who have given up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto a vitious, sensual, worldly Course of Life, having either fallen into it by the Power of their <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or were never brought into a better Course by any Means of correcting the Vices of <hi>Nature,</hi> shall find, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what they are, what they know themselves to be, and what Judgement others must needs pass of them, yet that they are esteemed to <hi>belong to the Church of Christ,</hi> and are made partakers of all outward Priviledges of it, it cannot but greatly heighten their <hi>security</hi> in Sin, and weaken the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of all Means of their Reformation. And when others, not so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the wayes of Sin and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, shall see that they may have all <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Pledges of Divine Love</hi> and Favour communicated unto them, although they
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:204232:241"/> should run into the same compass of Riot and Excess with others, it cannot but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly weaken their <hi>Diligence</hi> in Duty, and render them more pliable Subjects of <hi>Temptations</hi> unto Sin. For they are but <hi>few</hi> who care to be <hi>better</hi> than they judge they must be of <hi>Necessity.</hi> When the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> was really <hi>dead,</hi> the principal Means of keeping it in that Condition, was the <hi>Name</hi> it had to be <hi>alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore consider, how it hath been in the World in this Matter. Whilest these things have been communicated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously unto all sorts of Men, yea to the <hi>worst</hi> that live on the Earth, is it not evident that the Name of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Administration of its Ordinances would be made use of to countenance Men in a Neglect of <hi>Holiness,</hi> yea a <hi>Contempt</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> of it. Whilest these Sacred Names, Titles and Priviledges, these Pledges of the <hi>Love</hi> of God, and of all the <hi>Benefits</hi> of the <hi>Mediation</hi> of Christ are forced to Lacquey after Men into the most <hi>provoking Courses</hi> of flagitious <hi>Sins,</hi> what can put a stay to the Lusts of Men? If the Church be that <hi>Society</hi> in the World which is alone the Object of Gods <hi>especial Love</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> if the <hi>principal End</hi> of the Administration
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:204232:242"/> of its Ordinances be to Confirm unto Men their Interest in the <hi>Benefits</hi> of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation</hi> of Christ, how can the Lusts of Men be more accommodated than by the <hi>Application</hi> of these things unto them, whilest they are <hi>flagrant</hi> in their pursuit? It may indeed be supposed, that the Lord Jesus Christ hath made <hi>Evangelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to be the immoveable <hi>Rule</hi> of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> in his Church; Indeed, whether Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto the <hi>Precepts of the Gospel</hi> be not the onely and indispensable <hi>Condition</hi> of a Participation of the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the Gospel, ought to be out of Dispute with them that own the <hi>Truth</hi> of its Doctrine. And whereas all that is required of us that we may be Eternally <hi>saved,</hi> is contained in the <hi>Precepts of the Gospel,</hi> men can have no other <hi>outward security</hi> of their Souls welfare, than what doth accompany the <hi>Church</hi> and its Rights. When therefore they do find on what easie terms they may hold an <hi>undefeasible Interest</hi> in them, so as that by a Complyance with some <hi>outward Forms</hi> or Constitutions, they may secure their Right from any Impeachment or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture by the most <hi>profligate Course</hi> of Life which for the Satisfaction of their Lusts they can betake themselves unto, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:204232:242"/> of <hi>outward Means</hi> that can put a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint upon them?</p>
               <p>This was the <hi>Engine</hi> whereby Sathan promoted that General Apostasie from <hi>Evangelical Obedience</hi> which befell the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> in all its Branches, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Adherents. For, after that innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Multitudes were brought into the <hi>Profession of Christianity,</hi> not through a Conviction and Experience of its <hi>Truth, Power, Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Peace and eternal Welfare of the Souls of Men; but in Complyance with the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> of the Nations and their own <hi>Secular Interest,</hi> being once safely lodged (on most easie and gentle terms) in the Church, they were quickly secured from all Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of that <hi>Holiness</hi> which the Gospel doth require. For being assured, that although their <hi>Lives</hi> were worse than those of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> were they never so lewd, filthy and wicked, did all manner of Sins that may be named, or ought to be named, abound among them; yet that <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>they alone</hi> were the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ, and could not be otherwise, to what purpose should they trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with <hi>Mortification, Self-denyal, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heart</hi> and <hi>Hands,</hi> and such other
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:204232:243"/> ungratefull Duties? What Ground is there to expect the same Course of Obedience from them who engaged into a <hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> on these Terms, with those who in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Times embraced the <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Love</hi> of it, for its <hi>own sake,</hi> with a deliberate Resolution to foregoe <hi>all things,</hi> rather than to forsake its <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> or decline from its <hi>Commands?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Especially were Men confirmed in their <hi>Security</hi> when they saw others <hi>condemned Body and Soul unto Hell,</hi> and consumed with <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> in this World, for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what <hi>they</hi> were, that is, <hi>the Church.</hi> They could not choose but applaud their own Happiness, who on such easie Terms were certainly freed from <hi>present</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Flames. When hereunto for the necessary Satisfaction of some Convictions, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs of <hi>Confession, Penances, Commutation</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> of Sins by outward <hi>Works</hi> of supposed Piety or Charity were found out, with the great Reserve of <hi>Purgatory</hi> in all Dubious Cases, the Generality of Men bid an <hi>open Farewell</hi> unto the <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Gospel,</hi> as that wherein they were not concerned, and wherewith they would not be troubled.</p>
               <p>In these things consisted the <hi>Mystery of</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:204232:243"/>
                  <hi>Iniquity,</hi> the Springs and Occasions of that <hi>great Apostasie</hi> which was in the World under the <hi>Papacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>the Gospel</hi> (as to its peculiar Nature, the Causes, Motives and Ends of it) was generally <hi>lost,</hi> partly through the horrible <hi>Ignorance</hi> of some, and partly through the pernitious <hi>Errors</hi> of others, whose Duty it was to have <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> it. And how impossible it is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of Obedience when this Spring of it is <hi>dryed</hi> up or <hi>corrupted,</hi> when this Root is withered and decayed, is not hard to apprehend. Sometimes <hi>Truth</hi> is lost <hi>first</hi> in a Church, and then <hi>Holiness;</hi> and sometimes the <hi>decay</hi> or <hi>hatred</hi> of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is the Cause of the <hi>loss</hi> of Truth; but where either is <hi>rejected,</hi> the other will not <hi>abide;</hi> as we have declared. And so it fell out in that <hi>fatal Apostasie;</hi> These Evils pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted and furthered each other.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The <hi>Ground</hi> got by the loss of <hi>Truth,</hi> was secured by the Application of the <hi>Name, Title, Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> unto all sorts of Men, though living <hi>impenitently</hi> in their sins. For there was and is virtually contained therein an <hi>Assurance</hi> given unto them, that they are in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein the Lord Christ requires
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:204232:244"/> they should be, which he accepts, approves, and hath annexed the Promises of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel unto. When men were declared to be in this Estate, what need they be at any Pains or Charge to have it <hi>changed</hi> or <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered?</hi> Certainly, in <hi>general</hi> they are too much in <hi>love</hi> with their Lusts, Sins and Pleasures to part with them, unless they see a greater <hi>necessity</hi> for it than such a Condition would admit. And for their further Security herein, they were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> did by virtue of their Administration alone conferre unto them all the Grace which they do signifie. Particularly they were taught to believe, That every one who had a <hi>Mouth,</hi> (whatever Villanies his Heart and Life were filled withall,) might <hi>eat the Flesh,</hi> and <hi>drink the Blood</hi> of. Jesus Christ, (at least by Concomitancy,) which himself hath assured us, that who so doth, <hi>shall have Eternal Life; Joh.</hi> 6. 53, 54. And other wayes almost innumerable there were, whereby through their pretended Interest in the <hi>Church</hi> and its <hi>Priviledges,</hi> even <hi>flagitious Sinners</hi> were secured of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and Glory.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) For the Encrease of their <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of the confirming of their <hi>Security,</hi>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:204232:244"/> they found that <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Destruction</hi> were denounced onely against them who were not of the <hi>Church.</hi> For besides one great Maxim of Truth which passed currant amongst them, but falsely applyed unto their Advantage, namely, <hi>That out of the Church there was no Salvation,</hi> which Church they were; and one also of no less Use to them, though of less Truth in it self, That the Church was like <hi>Noahs Arke, all were saved that were in it, and all drowned that were out of it,</hi> with others of an alike encouraging Nature, they saw the Truth of them exemplified before their Eyes. For if it so fell out, that there were any who did not belong unto the Church as they did, nor would comply with it, although they were evidently in their Wayes and Lives more Righteous than themselves, they saw them by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, <hi>Cursed, Condemned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, Cast into Dungeons,</hi> and <hi>consumed</hi> with <hi>Flames.</hi> And herewith they could not but be fully satisfied, that there was no Fear of Danger and Trouble in this World or another, but onely in not being of the Church, which Sin they were resolved not to be guilty of, seeing they could avoyd it on so easie Terms. And it will be found
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:204232:245"/> alwayes true, that as <hi>Persecutions,</hi> with the Sufferings of the Saints of God, do tend to the <hi>brightening</hi> of the Grace of some, and the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the Faith of others who really Believe; so they do greatly unto the <hi>Obdurateness</hi> and <hi>Impenitency</hi> of Wicked men in their Sins. Never was there a more pernitious Engine against the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Gospel invented, than for <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christians</hi> to persecute, hurt and destroy others in like manner professing <hi>Christian Religion</hi> with themselves, who visibly excell them in an holy fruitfull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, because in some things they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from them. For what can more <hi>secure</hi> Men in their Impietyes, than to perswade them that they are <hi>justified</hi> in them by the Rule of the Gospel, above those who in all Duties of <hi>Morality</hi> do really excell them. Certainly, for Swearers and Drunkards, Prophane persons and Unclean, to <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi> such for Religion as are visibly <hi>pious, sober, temperate,</hi> given unto <hi>Prayer</hi> and good <hi>Works,</hi> is no usefull Representation of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="4">(4) These <hi>Priviledges</hi> and these <hi>Attestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were not <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>alwayes</hi> such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Proof unto Sinners, but that some <hi>Arrows of Conviction</hi> would ever and anon
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:204232:245"/> pierce into their Minds and Consciences, giving them no small Disquietment and Trouble. One thing or other, either in some Beam of Truth from the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or from <hi>Conscience</hi> it self, on the Occasions of New <hi>Surprizals</hi> in Actual Sin, or from <hi>Fear,</hi> or an Apprehension of some <hi>publick Judgements,</hi> would ever and anon befall them, and that unto an <hi>inward Disturbance,</hi> beyond what the <hi>Advantages</hi> mentioned could reduce them from. And this was the most likely way of awaking them out of their <hi>Security,</hi> and causing them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what God yet required of them. In this Case were the other Helps and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes mentioned, found out and proposed unto them. If it be so that you are not absolutely satisfied with your Interest in the <hi>Advantages</hi> of the Church in <hi>general,</hi> if Sin will yet give you any Disquietment, then you must to <hi>Confession,</hi> and <hi>Penances,</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of Redemption, with the like approved Medicines and Remedies for Troubled Minds. But if the Conscience of any prove so <hi>stubhorn</hi> or inflexible after all these Mollifying and suppling Medicines, that the Wound will not be <hi>skinned over,</hi> all that is yet wanting shall be well issued and secured in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> wherein it is
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:204232:246"/> most certain, that never any Soul did mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.</p>
               <p>By these and the like Means, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Mankind was brought into an utter Inconcernment with <hi>Gospel-Holiness.</hi> They neither understood it, nor found any need of it, nor did like what by any Means they might hear of it; untill at length <hi>a blind Devotion,</hi> deformed with various Superstitions, obtained the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it; the World in the mean time being drenched in Ignorance, Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and all manner of wicked Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So under the Name of the <hi>Church</hi> and its <hi>Priviledges,</hi> were <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> almost utterly lost amongst men.</p>
               <p>It will not be otherwise where the same Principles are entertained, according unto the degrees of their Prevalency. And were it not but that the Minds of Men are pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully influenced with Reserves from these things, it were impossible that so many <hi>called Christians,</hi> should in their Lives and Conversations exceed <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> in Wickedness. The Commands of the Gospel are most <hi>holy,</hi> its Promises <hi>great,</hi> and its Threatnings most <hi>severe;</hi> and yet under a <hi>Profession</hi> of owning them all, Men lead Lives worse than the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:204232:246"/> knew nothing of that holy Rule, or those Promises and Threats of Eternal things wherein the highest Blessedness and utmost Misery of our <hi>Natures</hi> do consist, which these profess to be regulated by.</p>
               <p>To suppose really the least Countenance to be given hereunto by any thing that belongs unto the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is to exercise against it the highest Despite imaginable. This Event therefore must and doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally follow on the undue Application of the <hi>outward Tokens</hi> of Gods Favour and Pledges of Eternal Blessedness unto Men in their Sins, by those unto whom the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration</hi> of them is supposed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Jesus Christ. And let none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Return of a <hi>Conversation</hi> becoming the Gospel among Christians, untill things are so ordered in the Church, as that none may flatter themselves with a supposed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the Gospel, who live not in a visible Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto and Complyance with all the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> of it. But whilest all things are hudled together promiscuously, and there is no more required to make a Christian, than for him to be Born in such a Place or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do not oppose the Customs and Usages in Religion which are there Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished;
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:204232:247"/> we must be content to bear the Evils of that <hi>Defection</hi> which the World groans under.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; <hi>Great Examples</hi> of Persons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in Places of <hi>Eminency</hi> giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto <hi>Boldness</hi> in a Course of <hi>Sinning,</hi> which have fallen out in all the latter Ages of the Church, have had a signal Influence into the Encrease and Furtherance of this <hi>Apostasie.</hi> Especially they have had so where the Persons giving such Examples have been such as pretend unto the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Religion;</hi> See <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23. 15. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any Modesty be denyed, but that the flagitious scandalous Lives of many <hi>Popes</hi> and other great <hi>Prelates</hi> of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> have hurried many into the very Depths of <hi>Atheisme,</hi> and countenanced Multitudes in a careless, voluptuous, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Course of Life. And if at any time a Man whose Wayes are made conspicuous by the Eminency of his Employment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were at the Head of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that is publickly professed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the chief Conduct of it in his hand, as it is in the <hi>Papacy</hi> in many places, be <hi>vain</hi> in his Communication, <hi>prophane</hi> in his Principles, <hi>sensual</hi> in his Course of Life, <hi>negligent</hi> in the Duties of his Office, no
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:204232:247"/> way <hi>rebuking</hi> open Sins, but taking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them that doe them; it is incredible how soon an whole Age or Generation of professed Christians, will be influenced, corrupted, and debauched thereby. For what is the Family like to be, when the <hi>Stewards</hi> are such as the evil Servant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 48, 49, 50. As men are warned every day <hi>not to be wiser than their Teachers,</hi> but duly to <hi>obey their Guides,</hi> so they either cannot or will not for the most part see any Reason why they should be <hi>better</hi> than they, or walk in any other Paths than what they tread before them. When the <hi>Sons of Eli,</hi> the Sons and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of the High-Priest, actually exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Priests Office in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, gave the People an open Example of <hi>Prophaneness</hi> and <hi>Lewdness</hi> of Life, the Body of the Nation was quickly so far cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, as that the Judgements of God in the <hi>first Captivity of the Land</hi> ensued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The World at present is so <hi>precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> and <hi>headstrong</hi> in a Course of Sin, that the best Examples are not able in any measure to stemme the Torrents of it. But if in any Place, at any Time, Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are given unto men by any eminent Examples in sinning, helping to remove
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:204232:248"/> the remaining Curbs of Fear, Shame, and Reputation, Impudence in <hi>sinning</hi> will arise unto an exorbitant and uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Outrage. Hereby then hath the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from Holiness</hi> complained of, been greatly promoted in all Ages; for few or none of them have wanted <hi>plenty</hi> of these Examples. Indeed the first visible <hi>Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racyes</hi> of Christianity, as they <hi>accompanyed</hi> so they were <hi>occasioned</hi> by the open Pride, Ambition, Strife, Contentions, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto the World, that possessed the Minds and stained the Lives of far the greatest part of the <hi>Prelates</hi> and principal Leaders of the Church, after it came under the Protection of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and men thought to purchase an Interest in the good things of Religion, or at least a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation</hi> of them, by giving Power, Wealth and Honour, unto persons no way <hi>better</hi> than themselves, who had got the Name and Title of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> or Guides of the Church. For about these things they contended endlessely, to the shame of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and the utter Loss in the most of the true real <hi>power</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> of it. And in following Ages as things grew worse and worse, the lewd and wicked Lives of <hi>Popes, Prelates</hi> and others, signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:204232:248"/> unto the World by their Power and Dignity, did by their Examples insensibly bring about a publick Conformity unto their Vices, according as the Concurrence of Opportunity and Ability did enable men thereunto. Wherever therefore Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons shall fall within the Compass of the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the Church, or as Guides thereof are on that Account (on what Principles soever,) exalted unto places of Eminence or Dignity, whereby they are made Conspicuous and Observable, if they do not proportionably excell others in <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible exemplary Holiness,</hi> at least, if they be not Unblameable in such a <hi>godly</hi> Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation as truely expresseth the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Gospel, in Humility, Meekness, Contempt of the World, sensual Pleasures, and the Pride of Life, Zeal and Diligence in the Dispensation of the Word, it cannot be but that <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the Gospel, as to its <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> will be kept up and promoted.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; This <hi>Apostasie</hi> hath been very much promoted by <hi>Persecution.</hi> I mean not that Persecution which hath befallen the sincere constant Professors of Christianity from the <hi>avowed Enemies</hi> thereof, upon the Account of their Profession of it. This is
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:204232:249"/> so far from being any Cause or Occasion of a Defection from the <hi>Holiness of the Gospel,</hi> as that it hath been the peculiar Glory of our Religion, and a notable outward Means of the Encrease of it. So hath it been with respect unto the whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel in general, and so it is with respect unto any especial <hi>Branch</hi> or part it. It was the <hi>primitive Glory</hi> of Christian Religion, that it set out in the face of an <hi>universal Opposition</hi> from the whole World, and not onely made good its Station, but encreased under the fiercest Persecutions, untill it had finished that glorious Conquest which it was designed unto. And not onely did it preserve its <hi>Being,</hi> and enlarge its <hi>Extent</hi> under them, but they were <hi>Means</hi> also to preserve its <hi>Purity,</hi> and to exert its <hi>Power</hi> in the Hearts and Lives of its Professors. The Church never lost <hi>finally</hi> either <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Holiness</hi> by the violent Persecutions of its avowed Enemies. But I speak not of the Outrages committed on the <hi>flock of Christ</hi> by <hi>Wolves</hi> in their own Skins, but by such as have got on <hi>Sheeps-cloathing;</hi> for these things in whomsoever they are, proceed from the uncured <hi>wolvish Nature</hi> in persons on whom the Gospel hath not obtained its promised Efficacy; <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 6,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:204232:249"/> 7, 8, 9. It is <hi>professing Christians</hi> persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another, about some differences among themselves concerning their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of <hi>spiritual</hi> things and Practice of Divine Worship, that I intend. And this hath been so great, especially in the <hi>latter Ages of the Church,</hi> that it is questionable whether there hath not greater Effusion of the Blood of Christians, Ruine of Families, and Devastation of Nations, been made by them who have professed the same <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> in General, than by all the <hi>Pagans</hi> in the World since the first Promulgation of it. He that shall <hi>impartially</hi> read the Gospel, will not be able to discern how it was possible, that any such things should ever fall out among those who pretend to avow it as their Rule and Guide, in any measure. For the whole Design, and all the Rules of it are so expressely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory unto any such practice, as that no Man who had not learned the contrary from the Event, could possibly conjecture that any persons could ever fall into it, without an antecedent <hi>Renunciation</hi> of the Gospel it self. But thus in process of time it did fall out unto the irreparable <hi>scandal</hi> and <hi>detriment</hi> of Christian Religion; and that so it would do, was fore-told. For
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:204232:250"/> the principal Design of the <hi>Book of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> is, to foretell and delineate such an <hi>Apostate-state</hi> of the Church, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>External Power</hi> prevailing in it, should persecute, destroy and kill those who would not comply in the <hi>Apostasie;</hi> for which reason together with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that State is called <hi>Babylon.</hi> And we all know how it came to pass under the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Prevalency of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And we may observe, that upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Babylon</hi> it is said, that in her was found the Blood of the <hi>Prophets and Saints, and all that were slain on the Earth; Rev.</hi> 18. 24; that is, for the Gospel and the Profession thereof. Whoever therefore offereth Violence unto the Life of any on the Account of their Profession of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel and Religion of Christ, be it under what pretense it will, he doth therein and so far joyn himself unto that <hi>Apostate-state</hi> which shall be destroyed. Our Lord Jesus Christ came to restore that <hi>Love of God</hi> which was departed from our Nature, and thereon that Love unto and among Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind which the Law of Creation Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally required, and that advanced unto an higher degree of Worth and Excellency by an Addition of new Motives, Duties
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:204232:250"/> and Ends unto it; He came to <hi>save the Lives of Men and not to destroy them,</hi> to deliver them out of a state of Enmity and mutual Hatred, into that of Peace and Love. And can any sober man imagine, that the Hurting, Imprisoning, Fining, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, Killing and destroying of Men for no other Reason or Cause in the World, but for <hi>Believing</hi> in Christ, and <hi>Worshipping</hi> of him according as they are invincibly convinced they ought to doe, is a good and due Representation of this Design of Christ? Nay, is it not evident that this Practice draws a Veil over the Glory of it, obscuring the principal attractive Beautyes of the Gospel, and teaching the World a Christian Religion, <hi>fierce, cruel, oppressive, vindictive, bloody,</hi> to the utter Exclusion of that which is so indeed. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more expedient Course to draw off the Minds of Men from the due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of one principal End of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation</hi> of Christ, (which is to turn them from the Gospel, and to substitute another Gospel in the room thereof, which yet is not <hi>another,</hi> because it is none, whatever it pretends;) than for those who profess Christian Religion to <hi>persecute</hi> others of the same Profession for their <hi>Profession,</hi> plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:204232:251"/> this to be a Duty of that Religion. Wherefore, when the Generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by what they heard and saw, were perswaded that this was the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, namely, Variously to <hi>persecute</hi> and at length to <hi>destroy</hi> others, who professing it did yet in some things dissent from them in <hi>Power,</hi> they had lost the <hi>true Gospel,</hi> and the Benefits of it.</p>
               <p>Besides, that Religion is <hi>alien</hi> from the Gospel, at least includes a notable <hi>Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from it, whose avowed Profession doth not represent the <hi>Spirit, Graces,</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> of him who was its Author. Yea, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> unto him in all things is the <hi>summe</hi> and <hi>substance</hi> of that Obedience which it doth require. But in this way of <hi>External Force</hi> and <hi>Persecution,</hi> there seems to be an Appearance of the Spirit of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Anti-Christ</hi> rather than our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> And hereby are the <hi>Minds</hi> of men infected with false <hi>Notions</hi> and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the <hi>Nature</hi> of Christian Religion, which whilest they Conform themselves unto, they depart from the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of it. It hath been sufficiently elsewhere evinced, how contrary also this Practice is to the most <hi>plain Rules</hi> and <hi>principal Ends</hi> of the Gospel. And when at any time there
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:204232:251"/> is this kind of <hi>Persecution</hi> prevailing among Christians, there is not so much as the <hi>form, face,</hi> or <hi>Appearance</hi> of Christianity left amongst men. All that Love, Charity, Peace, Meekness, Quietness, Condescension, Mercy, Compassion, Benignity, towards Mankind, which belong <hi>Essentially</hi> unto Christian Religion, are forced to give way to Wrath, Strife, Revenge, evil Surmizes, false Accusations, Tumults, Disorder, Force, Rapine, and every thing that is Evil. Whereas therefore this Course hath been steered in many places of the World, and yet continueth so to be, the Generality of Men must needs be much <hi>untaught</hi> the Truth of Religion thereby. For that kind of <hi>Profession</hi> thereof which is consistent with such Practises, is not directed in the least by the Gospel. And when the Minds of Men are hereby <hi>unframed,</hi> they are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited</hi> unto all other Evangelical Duties. Whatever Advantages any shall pretend to have by this Means accrueed unto the <hi>Truth</hi> (as they suppose) in some few Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet as none can be so immodest as to deny but that it hath been a thousand times more subservient unto the Interests of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;</hi> so no pretended Advantage of <hi>Truth</hi> can countervail that Corruption of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:204232:252"/>
                  <hi>Morality</hi> which hath been introduced and countenanced by it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly; Want of <hi>Watchfulness</hi> against the Insinuation of <hi>National Vices,</hi> and the <hi>prevailing Sins</hi> of any present Age hath effectually promoted an <hi>Apostasie</hi> from <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> among the Generality of Christians. There are some Vices, Crimes, or Sins, that particular Nations, (on what Grounds I shall not now enquire,) are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly enclined unto, which therefore abound in them. For it is evident what great Advantages those <hi>Vices</hi> must have on the <hi>Minds</hi> of men, and how easie it is to have their Practice imposed on them. All Men are continually encompassed with them in their Occasions, and <hi>commonness</hi> takes off the sense of their <hi>Guilt.</hi> That which would be looked on in one Nation as the greatest <hi>Debauchery</hi> of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is through <hi>Custom</hi> in another passed by without any Animadversion. Hence the <hi>Prevalency</hi> of the Gospel in any Nation may be measured by the Success it hath against <hi>known National Sins.</hi> If these are not in some good measure subdued by it, if the Minds of Men be not alienated from them and made watchfull against them, if their Guilt appear not naked without the Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:204232:252"/> or Veil put upon it by <hi>commonness</hi> or <hi>custom,</hi> whatever Profession is made of the Gospel, it is vain and useless. Thus the Apostle allows that there were <hi>National</hi> Sins prevalent among the <hi>Cretians, Tit.</hi> 1. 12, 13. <hi>One of themselves, a Prophet of their own said, The Cretians are alwayes Lyars, evil Beasts, slow Bellyes; this witness is true; Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the Faith.</hi> Whatever their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession were, if they were not deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gospel from the Power and Practice of these <hi>National Sins</hi> which they were so prone unto, they would not long be <hi>sound in the Faith,</hi> nor Fruitfull in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. So among the <hi>Jews</hi> there was a peculiar kind of <hi>Stubbornness</hi> and <hi>Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi> above any other Nation under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which God complaineth of in their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Generations from first to last, and which continueth to be their <hi>Characteristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Evil unto this Day. Hence <hi>Josiah</hi> was eminently commended, because his <hi>Heart was tender,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 27. He was not under the <hi>power</hi> of the common Sin of that People, which indeed includes all other Evils whatever. It was a rare thing to find one of a <hi>tender heart</hi> among them.</p>
               <p>And we may observe, (it being easily
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:204232:253"/> demonstrable,) that the <hi>great Apostasie</hi> which is at this day among the Nations which have received the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion consists in a <hi>Degeneracy</hi> into those <hi>Customs, Manners, Humours,</hi> and <hi>course of Conversation</hi> which were common among them, and <hi>National</hi> before the entrance of <hi>Christianity.</hi> Set aside an <hi>outward Profession</hi> and Formality of Worship, and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men in most Nations live as they did formerly, and are given up greatly unto those Vices which were prevalent among them in their <hi>Heathenism.</hi> A full Evidence this is, that the <hi>Power</hi> of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Truth is lost among them, the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy thereof consisting in curing the <hi>Vices of Nature,</hi> and those Evils which men have been most habituated unto, as the Prophet at large declares; <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Thus the Sin of this Nation hath been alwayes esteemed <hi>Sensuality of Life,</hi> in an Excess of Eating and Drinking, with the Consequents thereof. Hereunto of late hath been added <hi>Vanity in Apparel,</hi> with foolish, light, lascivious Modes and Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings therein, and an immodest Boldness in Conversation among Men and Women. These were Corruption; which being bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the <hi>Neighbour Nation,</hi> and
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:204232:253"/> grafted on Crab-stocks of our own, have brought forth the Fruit of Vanity and Pride in abundance. And it is the most manifest Evidence of a degenerate People when they are prone to <hi>naturalize the Vices of other Nations</hi> among them, but care not to imitate their <hi>Vertues</hi> if in any kind they do excell. But thus the <hi>Lust of the Eyes</hi> and <hi>the Pride of Life</hi> are joyned unto the <hi>Lusts of the Flesh,</hi> to give the World, (as opposite unto God,) a compleat Interest among us. It may be these things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained in some by <hi>contrary Vices,</hi> as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness and an earnest Desire or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to enrich a Family, and leave a Name amongst Men, a Vanity infused amongst Mankind from the great Design of the <hi>Builders of Babel,</hi> which was to make unto themselves a Name; <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 4. This is but another way of the Exercise of the same Sin.</p>
               <p>Now where Sins are thus <hi>National</hi> and <hi>common,</hi> it is Easier for Men to preserve themselves from the most raging <hi>Epidemical Disease,</hi> than from being in one degree or other tainted with the Infection of them. It is almost inexpressible how <hi>efficaciously</hi> they will insinuate themselves into the Minds and Lives of Men. They are so beset on
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:204232:254"/> every side with the Occasions of them, and Temptations unto them, they offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves continually with so many specious Pretences, as that there is no Security against them but by being encompassed with the <hi>whole Armour of God,</hi> a Matter that few understand or apply themselves unto. But it is not on any other Grounds or by any other Means for single Persons to hold out and prevail against a <hi>National</hi> Confederacy in Sin. For they who will not say a <hi>Confederacy to them,</hi> or in those things wherein an whole <hi>People shall say a Confederacy,</hi> must be contented to be <hi>for Signs and Wonders,</hi> to be despised and even hooted at; <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 11, 12, 18. However it is apparent, that by them the <hi>general Apostasie</hi> we treat of, is visibly and openly promoted. Some are engaged in them by a corrupt Course of <hi>Education,</hi> and some are betrayed into the Entrances of them by <hi>Sloth, Negligence,</hi> and <hi>Security;</hi> some lose a Sense of their Guilt by their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monness;</hi> some yield to the Arguments that are pleaded, if not in their <hi>justification,</hi> yet in their <hi>excuse,</hi> or for their <hi>extenuation;</hi> one way or other, <hi>Multitudes</hi> of all sorts are by them turned away from <hi>Gospel Obedience.</hi> Hence it is come to pass▪ that <hi>Christianity</hi>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:204232:254"/> is (as unto Customs, Manners, Vanities, Vices, and Way of Conversation,) sunk down into <hi>Heathenisme;</hi> or prevalent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Sins have drowned the <hi>power,</hi> and left little but the <hi>outward Form</hi> of it in the World. And where it is so, the Life, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and all the real Benefits of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel are renounced. For it doth not design onely to turn men in their <hi>outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> from <hi>dumb Idols to serve the living God,</hi> to change the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>outward State</hi> of Religion, as the <hi>Roman Missiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> have made Conversions of the <hi>Indians,</hi> giving them New <hi>Images</hi> instead of their Old <hi>Idols,</hi> and New <hi>Saints</hi> for their former <hi>Zemes;</hi> but to turn men also <hi>from all Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness and worldly Lusts, to live soberly, righteously and godly in this World.</hi> Where this is not effected, either the Gospel ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver really prevailed among men, or they are fallen away from it. And where men do ingage into a Profession of Religion disallowing and condemning such <hi>National Vanities, Vices</hi> and <hi>Customes,</hi> if they are publickly countenanced, they occasion <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Apostasies</hi> every day. This is that which on the one side and the other hath almost lost the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> in some neighbour Nations. For not being able to
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:204232:255"/> hold out against those <hi>National Vanities and Vices</hi> which are publickly countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, they find no Relief unto their Minds but in a <hi>Renunciation</hi> of that Religion by which they are condemned. And this I look upon as the principal Means of that general Defection from <hi>Evangelical Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which prevails in most Nations: The Gospel comes upon a Nation as on a <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi> or <hi>Forrest</hi> that is full of such Wood, Thorns and Bryars, as the Soyl of it self is peculiarly disposed to produce. These it cuts down to the ground, planting <hi>good and Noble Plants</hi> in their room, whereby the barren Wilderness becomes for a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son a fruitfull Field; But in process of time, if continual <hi>care</hi> and <hi>culture</hi> be not used about it, the Earth pours out of its own accord the <hi>Weeds and Briars</hi> which are Natural unto it. These springing up abundantly, choak the <hi>other Plants and usefull Herbs,</hi> whereby the fruitful Field is turned again into a Wilderness. There needs no more unto this Apostasie, but that <hi>National Vices</hi> for a time suppressed by the <hi>Power</hi> of the Word, should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow the Generality of any People, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Graces</hi> of the Gospel will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly stifled and choaked.</p>
               <pb n="487" facs="tcp:204232:255"/>
               <p> Sixthly; <hi>Mistakes about the Beauty and Glory of Christian Religion</hi> have been no small Cause of Apostasie from its <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Holiness.</hi> That it should have a <hi>Glory,</hi> somewhat that might render it Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Eyes and Esteem of Men was alwayes thought unquestionable, and it is certainly true; provided that we suppose those with whom we have to doe, have Eyes <hi>to see that Glory,</hi> and Minds enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make a true Judgement of it. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance herewithall was Religion outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly figured and represented among the <hi>Jews.</hi> And as the Apostle declares that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God in the Administration of the Gospel is <hi>truely glorious,</hi> and eminently so above what was to be found in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Law; so Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is in it self truely honourable, and contains in it every thing that is so, in the Judgement of God and the rectified Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Mankind. But about the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Apprehension of that <hi>Glory and Honour</hi> which is proper unto <hi>Religion,</hi> and suited unto its <hi>Nature,</hi> men have fallen into many wofull Mistakes. For whereas it principally consists in the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Operations of the Holy Spirit,</hi> Renewing our Natures, Transforming us into the
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:204232:256"/> Image and <hi>Likeness</hi> of God, with the Fruits of his <hi>Grace</hi> in Righteousness and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, in a meek, humble, gracious <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,</hi> and the Performance of all <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> according to the <hi>Rule;</hi> few are able to discern Beauty or Glory or Honour in these things. But yet where there is not <hi>an Eye to discern them,</hi> the Gospel must of necessity be despised and abandoned, and somewhat else substituted in the room thereof. This therefore also proved a great furtherance of the <hi>general Apostasie,</hi> and continues an Efficacious Means of keeping Multitudes under the <hi>power</hi> of it unto this Day. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Through the Loss of <hi>spiritual Light,</hi> and Neglect of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, things were come to that pass in the World, that those who had the Conduct of Religion <hi>saw no real Glory themselves</hi> in the things wherein all the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Religion taught and appointed in the <hi>Gospel</hi> doth consist. And they are but few that do so at this Day. Therefore the Profession that is made of them by any, is generally looked on as <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> mixed with a certain kind of <hi>Superstition,</hi> and is accordingly despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Yea nothing is more contemptible in the World, than the <hi>possession</hi> and <hi>profession</hi>
                  <pb n="489" facs="tcp:204232:256"/> of those Wayes which are <hi>truely</hi> if not <hi>onely</hi> Noble. Their View therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lost in the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the Leaders of the Church, it could not be expected that they should be instrumentul to open the Eyes of others, or carefull to instruct <hi>them</hi> how to look after what themselves did not discern.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were fully satisfied, that there was in these things no <hi>Evidence of Glory</hi> unto the Eyes of the Generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind whereunto they thought it Wisdom to accommodate themselves and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Religion. Men naturally can see no more <hi>Beauty</hi> in the spiritual Powers of <hi>Christianity,</hi> than the <hi>Jews</hi> could see in the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> when they rejected him, because unto them he made no Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof; <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 2. That <hi>Religion</hi> should be set off and represented as truely <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>honourable</hi> in the Eyes of Men, they thought it incumbent on them to take Care. But leaving herein the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> as declared in the Scripture, they accommodated themselves unto the carnal Apprehensions of them with whom they had to doe, which were also suited unto their own. Wherefore, that this <hi>Glory</hi> of
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:204232:257"/> Religion consisted in a <hi>Ministry</hi> in the Church humble, holy, laborious, eminent in the Graces and Gifts of the Spirit, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for no Honour or Respect but <hi>for their Works sake;</hi> in a <hi>Worship</hi> plain, unadorned, spiritual, whose Life and Excellency con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the invisible, effectual Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit of God, in <hi>Meekness, Self-denyal, Mortification</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and the Fruits of <hi>Righteousness</hi> proceeding from the <hi>Grace</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> they neither did apprehend themselves, nor could imagine that others would be of that Mind. For the World generally supposeth the direct contrary unto all these to be <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>glorious.</hi> Things which have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense of <hi>Height and Gallantry of Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Religious Worship</hi> set off with such Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Modes as to affect the outward Senses, with somewhat that may give Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction unto <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> at the same time, are the things which unto the most are alone desireable. Wherefore, all Pretence unto the <hi>Power</hi> of Religion Dwindling away into an empty jejune <hi>Form</hi> and Appearance of it in <hi>Monkery,</hi> the supposed <hi>Glory</hi> of Christianity in the World issued in these three things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>secular Pomp and Grandeur of</hi>
                  <pb n="491" facs="tcp:204232:257"/>
                  <hi>the Rulers of the Church.</hi> This was designed to beget a Reverence unto their <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> without which <hi>Religion</hi> it self would be despised. And it is easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable how by this Means their Minds were drawn off from a <hi>due consideration</hi> of all those things which are truely <hi>honourable</hi> in them, and the Neglect whereof will be the loss of the <hi>Power</hi> of Religion in the most at any time. For when they had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured unto themselves that <hi>Honour,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and Reverence, which they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed needfull unto the <hi>Glory of Religion,</hi> and found very suitable unto their own Desires and Ends, to what purpose should they trouble or perplex themselves with those <hi>hard Duties</hi> of Exemplary Mortification, Self-denyal, and painfull Labour in the Work of the Ministry, when the whole of what they aimed at, or needed, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them. And how corrupt a Spring of <hi>Apostasie</hi> brake forth hereon, hath been before declared.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) A <hi>Pompous Ceremonious Worship,</hi> which began to be introduced by a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Outward <hi>Solemnity,</hi> and ended in plain <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by were the Minds of Men diverted and taken off from inquiring after that <hi>spiritual</hi>
                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:204232:258"/>
                  <hi>Exercise</hi> of the Graces and Gifts of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> wherein alone the <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Evangelical Holiness</hi> doth consist.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) In Works of <hi>Magnificence</hi> and <hi>Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Clergy</hi> were enriched, and the <hi>Consciences</hi> of Men pacified in a Course of <hi>Sin</hi> or an <hi>unholy Life.</hi> When the World was once perswaded, that in these things consisted the <hi>Glory and Beauty of Religion,</hi> and found them all readily complyant with their Lusts and Darkness, that real Holiness and Obedience which is required in the Gospel was every day more and more neglected and despised. Besides, it is not expressible, what wicked scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Practices</hi> in Pride, Ambition, Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Contentions among the <hi>Leaders</hi> of the Church, did spring from and ensue on these Principles. Henceforward no small part of <hi>Ecclesiastical Story</hi> is taken up with fierce <hi>Contentions</hi> and <hi>Quarrels</hi> about the Preheminence, Dignities, Priviledges and Jurisdiction of the <hi>Prelates.</hi> Those who were wise and sober among the <hi>Heathen</hi> observed this Evil among <hi>Christians,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it as that whereby their <hi>Religion</hi> was debased and corrupted. Such is the Account given by <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> of that bloody and scandalous Conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:204232:258"/>
                  <hi>Damasus</hi> and <hi>Ʋrsicinus,</hi> whether of them should be <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome, Lib.</hi> 27. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, During these Seasons, <hi>Sathan</hi> (as he will never be,) was not wanting unto his own <hi>Occasions</hi> and <hi>Advantages;</hi> And they are altogether <hi>ignorant of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> who discern him not at work even at present unto the same End and Purpose. Nor is it possible that in any Age, Time, or Place, the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Gospel should be abated, and the principal <hi>Endeavour</hi> therein not to belong to him. He is the <hi>Head and Leader</hi> of every Apostasie from God. Therein he began his Work in this World, and in the Promotion of it, he will finish it. And as he ingaged all his Power and Art against the <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> so by his total Defeat in that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, wherein he made the clearest Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> against God, that it is possible for him to doe, he is not discouraged from pursuing the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign against the <hi>whole Church</hi> it self. And the way now insisted on, hath been the <hi>chiefest Path</hi> that he hath beaten in his Course. For, from the very Entrance of <hi>Christianity</hi> he began to immix himself with all those Lusts of Men whereby a <hi>Defection</hi>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:204232:259"/> from its <hi>power</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> might be set on foot and effected. And he engaged against it in both his Capacities, as a <hi>Lyon</hi> and as a <hi>Serpent;</hi> As a <hi>Lyon</hi> he stirred up, acted and animated all those bloody <hi>Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> World attempted for Three hundred years to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate the <hi>Christian Profession.</hi> But herein his Success was answerable to that of his Attempt against the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, and ever will be so, by <hi>virtue of the Victory</hi> the Lord Christ had over him in the same kind of Conflict. The Force of the <hi>Devil</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> having been once fully broken and subdued by <hi>Christ,</hi> it shall never prevail in the issue against his <hi>Followers.</hi> Sathan in a Confederacy with the World may as a <hi>Lyon</hi> through Rage and Blood make a great bluster, and <hi>scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the Churches of Christ for a Season, but <hi>prevail</hi> unto the Ruine of the Church in this way, he never did nor shall. And if at any time by <hi>National Devastations</hi> he do so far succeed as to expell the Gospel from any place or Countrey for a season, it shall be evident unto all that it shall turn greatly unto its <hi>Advantage</hi> in general, and in other places. Let not then any fear his <hi>bloody Fury</hi> as to the Interest of <hi>Christ</hi> and
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:204232:259"/> the <hi>Gospel</hi> in the World. As sure as he was conquered and triumphed over in the <hi>Cross</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> he shall finally be so in all such Attempts. Happy and blessed are they and shall they be, by whose Blood and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Ruine his <hi>power</hi> at any time is or shall be broken. So I say it fell out in his first Attempt in this way against <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> For through the Efficacy of the <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ, and by virtue of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obtained against him in his own Person, he was overcome by the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy</hi> of innumerable holy Souls, untill he was cast out of the Havens of the World, and an end was put unto his Rage. But in the mean time whilest this sworn Enemy of the Church made all this Bluster as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and raised all these storms of <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> which the Minds of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of <hi>Christianity</hi> were intent upon and generally much fortified against, he was secretly at work as a <hi>Serpent</hi> also. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he secretly and gradually infected the Minds of many with <hi>Ambition, Worldliness, Superstition,</hi> and a Neglect of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the Gospel. That this is his Work as <hi>a Serpent,</hi> our Apostle declares; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2, 3. And herein sometimes <hi>he transformed himself into an Angel of Light,</hi>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:204232:260"/> as he speaks in that place; <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14, 15. For he not onely <hi>poysoned</hi> and <hi>enflamed</hi> the Lusts of Men, but <hi>drew them aside</hi> from the <hi>Gospel</hi> by Suggestions and Pretences of <hi>more Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> or at least of other outward <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, than it did require. So did the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> work in the dayes of the Apostles themselves; 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2 7. He was at <hi>work</hi> secretly by Wayes and Means not easie to be discovered, to draw off the Minds of Men from <hi>Evangelical Truth</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> by sowing the Seeds of that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> which afterwards spread themselves over the Face of the whole <hi>visible Church.</hi> So was he the <hi>Spirit</hi> which animated the <hi>Apostasie</hi> which by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and insensible Degrees prevailed in the following Ages. Those who acted in it and promoted it, never knew any thing of the Design, but added one thing unto another, which gave it Encrease as Occasion was offered. But in him the <hi>Projection</hi> was designed, and regularly carryed on from the Beginning. Hence had it the Name of <hi>The Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> as being insinuated and promoted by such unsearchable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods or <hi>Depths of Sathan,</hi> that those for the most part who were subservient to his
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:204232:260"/> Design, knew not what they did, though sufficiently warned in the <hi>Scripture</hi> of what he would do, and what should come to pass. Wherefore, being disappointed (as was said) in his Endeavours by <hi>outward Force</hi> and <hi>Persecution,</hi> (as he will ever be) leaving the <hi>Name, Power</hi> and <hi>Advantage</hi> of the Church unto them that professed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, he made use of all the Darkness, Ignorance, Errours, Ambition and Lusts of Men, gradually to draw them from the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of the Gospel. And he ceased not untill he had brought <hi>Christian Religion</hi> to be looked on as made up <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,</hi> if not <hi>onely,</hi> of those things which by his Crafts and the Lusts of Men were introduced into it. So did he pursue his Work, almost undiscovered, untill the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of those who professed Christian Religion were given up to the Power of <hi>sensual Lusts</hi> on the one hand, or brought under the Power of <hi>Superstition</hi> on the other. All this he attempted, and in a great measure effected of his own Accord. But after that Men had voluntarily given up themselves unto his <hi>Delusions,</hi> rejecting the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of the Gospel, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>Love</hi> to them, and <hi>Delight</hi> in them, God in his righteous Judgements gave
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:204232:261"/> them up unto his <hi>Power,</hi> to be infatuated by him, and hardened, to their <hi>Eternal Ruine.</hi> So the Apostle expresseth it; 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>For this Cause God shall send them strong Delusions that they should believe a Lye; that they all might be damned who believed not the Truth, but had pleasure in Ʋnrighteousness.</hi> Thus was the Apostasie compleated under the <hi>Papacy.</hi> And by the same Artifices is <hi>Sathan</hi> still at work among <hi>us</hi> unto the same Ends and Purposes.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Among the <hi>Occasions</hi> of the present Decay of <hi>Holiness</hi> and the Power of <hi>Christianity</hi> in the World, we may reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the Scandal that hath been given by,</hi> or <hi>is justly taken at</hi> those who have <hi>professed</hi> the most <hi>strict Obedience</hi> unto the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> There is nothing difficult here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but onely to choose out the most preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Instances in the Multitudes which offer themselves, to evidence this Occasion. Nor do I intend such Offences as some men will <hi>enviously</hi> seek after, and sometimes <hi>cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly</hi> create, but such as are <hi>really given,</hi> and offer themselves unto the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all sorts of men. Of these I shall mention two onely, which are the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and extensive. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Offence</hi> hath been taken at the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
                  <pb n="499" facs="tcp:204232:261"/>
                  <hi>that have been among them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so to be,</hi> with the Mannagement of them in an <hi>evil contentious Frame of Spirit.</hi> The Lord Christ hath declared and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that the <hi>mutual Love</hi> of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples should be the <hi>great Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of his Doctrine, and the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of their Obedience. He hath also command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be one in Heart, Mind, and Affections, praying for them also that so they might be. His Commands and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections unto this Purpose are known unto all who know the Gospel, and so need not here to be repeated or insisted on. The Blessed Effects and Fruits of them were <hi>eminent</hi> for a Season among the Professors of the Gospel, and their <hi>mutual Love</hi> was a convincing Argument of the <hi>Truth, Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they did profess. For where there is <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> thereon, there is Peace, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Usefulness to Mankind, and every good Work; whereas the want of them is attended with Strife, Envy, Confusion, Disorder, and every evil work whatever. Some Divisions indeed happened among the <hi>primitive Christians,</hi> but were quickly healed by the Spirit of <hi>Apostolical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and that <hi>Love</hi> which was yet preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:204232:262"/> among them. But afterwards all things grew worse, and the first visible <hi>Degeneracy</hi> of Christianity consisted in the Strifes, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and Contentions of its <hi>Professors,</hi> especially of their <hi>Leaders.</hi> And these in no long process of Time proceeded unto that Excess, and were acted with such an evil Spirit of Pride, Ambition, Envy and Malice, that the very <hi>Heathens</hi> made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sport with their Contentions, and observed that there were no sort of Men in the World so Ready for them; and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable in them as the <hi>Christians</hi> of those dayes were. But when once one or other Party of them got into <hi>Power,</hi> and snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Sword of Force and Violence out of the hands of <hi>Pagans,</hi> which had been embrewed in the Blood of the <hi>Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> began in the pursuit of their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to <hi>persecute</hi> one another, (which way <hi>carnal</hi> Men having tasted the sweetness and Advantage of, as that which <hi>gratifying</hi> their Envy, Malice and Ambition, doth also (as they suppose) <hi>secure</hi> all their Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Concerns, they would not foregoe, nor have so done untill it is become the Top-stone of many mens Religion,) it was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the unspeakable Care and Mercy of God that they made not the <hi>Gospel</hi> an
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:204232:262"/>
                  <hi>Abhorrence</hi> unto all Flesh. For who, not yet endued with that <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> which might secure him from the <hi>power</hi> of such Temptations, could look on the fierce, devouring, <hi>bloody Contentions</hi> of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, and that solely on its <hi>own account,</hi> and not suppose that it self proceeded from a spirit of <hi>Malice, Strife</hi> and <hi>Disorder?</hi> But the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi> of God, preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it against all the Oppositions of its Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, and in the midst of the Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of its avowed Friends. Thus was it in the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> which as it was the first considerable stop unto the Progress of the Gospel, so it was one principal Cause of corrupting the Conversations of many, filling them with a Frame of spirit in all things directly opposite unto that of the Gospel. The Differences with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward Management which fell out among the <hi>first Reformers,</hi> was the chief Means that hindred their Work from an <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Success.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it much otherwise among the <hi>strictest sorts</hi> of Professors at this Day? Doe not some seem to aime at nothing more than to multiply and encrease <hi>Divisions,</hi> and to delight in nothing more than to Live and Dispute in the <hi>Flames</hi> of them? There is
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:204232:263"/> not the least different Apprehension of mens Minds about any thing in Religion, but such Persons suppose it a sufficient Ground to quarrel and contend about it for ever. By such Wayes and Means <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> are given unto the World in its prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto Apostasie, and seeking Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for it, or Countenance unto it, which is its present posture. For these things are not done in a corner. Men who know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>inward power</hi> and vertue of that Religion which is in such Professors as it is hoped, seeing and observing those other Distempers among them, are really <hi>alienated</hi> from all the Good they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess; and not onely so; but do from thence <hi>justifie</hi> and <hi>approve</hi> themselves in their <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness,</hi> as those which allow them a better Condition than such Wranglers can afford them. By this Means hath Religion lost much of that <hi>awfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> in the World whereby it oft-times put a Restraint on the Minds and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Men, who were never acted by its <hi>power.</hi> What are the <hi>Rules</hi> whereby we ought to walk under the <hi>Continuance</hi> of these Differences, and what are the best Means to put an Issue unto them, I have enquired in a Treatise unto that purpose.
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:204232:263"/> But it must be acknowledged, that for the most part, Attempts for the <hi>rebuking</hi> of these Distempers, the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the <hi>uniting</hi> of Professors, have been mannaged from such <hi>Principles,</hi> and in such a Frame of <hi>Spirit,</hi> as have height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and encreased rather than allayed or diminished them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Great <hi>Offence</hi> is given to the World by the <hi>Ʋselesness of Professors,</hi> and in that they are not what they ought to be, the <hi>common Good and Blessing of Mankind.</hi> There is a <hi>selfish</hi> Spirit on many of them, whence contenting themselves with <hi>Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> from known Sins, and the <hi>Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of the Religious Duties of Divine Worship, they are of little or no use unto others. Some will be <hi>kinde, benigne, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, good</hi> in some measure unto other men; but yet will and doe give undue Bounds and Limits unto their Actings in this kind. Their <hi>own Houshold,</hi> and the <hi>Houshold of Faith,</hi> according unto that measure which from Opinion or Prejudice they take of it, they will alone regard. As for Love, Condescension, Beniguity, Kindness, Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to help, assist and relieve <hi>all Mankind,</hi> yea the <hi>worst of Men</hi> as they have Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, they understand them not; yea have
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:204232:264"/> many Pretences that they are not required of them. But if we are <hi>Christians,</hi> it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us to <hi>abound in Love towards all men;</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 12. and our doing Good unto all, being Usefull unto all, exercising Loving Kindness in the Earth towards all, is the principal way whereby we may <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi> our sincere Obedience unto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. One <hi>Professor</hi> that is kind, benign, condescending, charitable, usefull, ready to <hi>become all things unto all men</hi> for their good, brings more Glory to the Gospel than an hundred who are looked on as those who live too much unto themselves. When the Old Saying was, <hi>Bonus vir Cajus Sejus, sed Malus quia Christianus;</hi> Such a one is a Good man, Evil onely in this that he is a Christian; Religion did by such Convictions insensibly get ground amongst men. If the World cannot see that it hath any <hi>advantage</hi> by Professors, but hath <hi>Trouble</hi> on the other hand by the Hatred which it cannot but have of their <hi>Profession,</hi> it is no wonder if it desire to have no more to doe with them. Did men find that so soon as any gave themselves unto the <hi>strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est wayes</hi> of Profession, that therewithall they became <hi>benign, kind, mercifull, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, usefull</hi> and <hi>helpfull</hi> unto all Men, it
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:204232:264"/> could not but give an Honourable Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in their Minds unto that Religion which they do profess. But an Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>contrary</hi> Frame and Temper in such Persons, and of how little <hi>use</hi> they are in the World, must needs produce <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Effects. By reason of such Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages as these and others of an alike Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby some Professors are so far from <hi>adorning the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> as that they cast (what lyes in them) a Blemish and Reproach upon it, others are every day hardened in their <hi>Alienation</hi> from all its Concerns.</p>
               <p>These <hi>few Instances</hi> have I given of the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Wayes</hi> whereby a <hi>general Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> from the Holy <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Gospel, as the Rule of our Obedience, hath been begun and carried on. Many others of an alike Nature might be added unto them; But it is to no purpose to insist long on the <hi>Nature of a Disease,</hi> when we find it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise all possible <hi>Remedyes. Sovereign Grace</hi> yet remaineth, whereunto this State of things is referred.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Apostasie</hi> in its Measure and Proportion partakes of the Guilt of that prescribed in the <hi>Text</hi> which we made the Foundation of this Discourse. For therein
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:204232:265"/> also is Christ <hi>crucifyed afresh, and put unto open shame.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) All Persons who <hi>profess</hi> the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and yet are thus fallen off or <hi>alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> from its <hi>Holiness,</hi> do really <hi>renounce</hi> and foregoe the <hi>Commands</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and those as enlivened by his <hi>Promises,</hi> for the <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>wages</hi> of Sin. And herein doe they openly declare and avow as the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Resolution of their <hi>Minds,</hi> That there is not that Excellency in his <hi>Precepts,</hi> nor that Goodness, Beauty, Desireablness or Satisfaction in <hi>Obedience</hi> unto them, or not that Assurance in his <hi>Promises,</hi> or Worth in the things <hi>promised,</hi> as that they ought to be preferred before the Course of the <hi>World</hi> and the Pleasures of <hi>Sin.</hi> Hence some <hi>Commands</hi> of the Gospel (and those of no small Importance unto the Furtherance of holy Obedience,) are neglected and cast from among the Generality of Christians. Such are the Commands for <hi>mutual Love,</hi> whereof there is scarce any shadow left in the World. For that Pretence of it which some seem to rest in, and plead for as <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,</hi> in the Peaceable and (as they say) loving Converse of Persons in their <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Distributions, is no other than what is found among <hi>Mahometans</hi>
                  <pb n="507" facs="tcp:204232:265"/> and <hi>Pagans</hi> on the like Occasion, which as it is good and commendable so far as it proceeds from and is suited unto the Light of Nature, so it no way answers either in the Kind of it or in its Acts and Fruits, unto that <hi>Evangelical Love</hi> which the Lord Christ requires among his Disciples. That <hi>Watchfulness</hi> over one another with Love Care and Tenderness, those <hi>mutual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,</hi> Exhortations and Consolations which the Gospel so frequently and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently prescribes unto us are not onely <hi>neglected,</hi> but so far <hi>despised</hi> that the very Naming of such Duties is made a matter of <hi>scorn,</hi> as a Pretence of <hi>hypocritical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseness.</hi> And no better Entertainment have many other of the <hi>Commands of Christ</hi> among the Generality of them that are called <hi>Christians.</hi> So do many, on all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, openly profess in their Walkings and Conversation, that they see no cogent Reason why they should comply with him in his <hi>Commands.</hi> And it is not easily to be conceived how they can cast a greater <hi>Dishonour</hi> or <hi>Contempt</hi> upon him.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) By continuing in the <hi>outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christianity,</hi> they do most <hi>falsely</hi> represent <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> unto the World, and thereby (what lyes in them) <hi>put</hi>
                  <pb n="508" facs="tcp:204232:266"/>
                  <hi>him to open shame.</hi> For, pretending to yield Obedience unto him, and to place their <hi>Hope</hi> for Life and Blessedness in Him by the Gospel, they profess withall that he is a Person that will <hi>approve of such Wayes as they walk in,</hi> and his Gospel a Doctrine that <hi>gives countenance</hi> unto all manner of Licentiousness in <hi>Sin.</hi> Who would judge otherwise who had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Him</hi> or <hi>It,</hi> but by the <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> that is made of them in the profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Conversation of such <hi>Apostates.</hi> But this Argument I have elsewhere insisted on.</p>

               <p>THat which was proposed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in the last place, is that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> which is in the World from the <hi>Purity of the Worship of the Gospel</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Jesus Christ. And herein prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally did consist that great <hi>Defection</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by our Apostle, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. which is also prophesied of in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and did accordingly come to pass. But because I have insisted on this Subject on many other Occasions, and some things relating thereunto are under <hi>Difference</hi> and <hi>Debate</hi> among such as are capable of the Warning given concerning the <hi>Apostasie</hi> that is in the World, I shall wholly wave the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of particulars, about which any such Differences may be, and onely mention such things as the Generality of Christians, at least of <hi>Protestants,</hi> cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <pb n="510" facs="tcp:204232:267"/>
               <p> I shall take it for granted at present, that our Lord Jesus Christ did <hi>institute and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a solemn Worship of God</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued inviolably and unalterably unto the End of the World. And the principal End of his appointing, continuing or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving any <hi>Church</hi> on the Earth, is the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of this Worship.</hi> For herein alone consisteth that <hi>publick Revenue</hi> of Glory which God requires from Believers in this World. All other Duties of the Gospel may be performed by Men in their <hi>single Capacities</hi> if there were no such thing as a <hi>Church</hi> on the Earth. And those <hi>Churches</hi> do exceedingly mistake their Duty, and the very End of their Being, which make it not their principal Business to take care of the due <hi>Celebration</hi> of that <hi>Worship</hi> which the Lord Christ hath appointed. <hi>He was faithfull in the whole House of God as was Moses; Heb.</hi> 3. 6. And if the Life, Being, Happiness and Welfare of the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> consisted in and depended on their Remembrance of the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> which God <hi>commanded unto him in Horeb, with the Statutes and Judgements; Mal.</hi> 4. 4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was <hi>faithfull in the House of God</hi> as a Servant; certainly the Being and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> consists in and
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:204232:267"/> depends upon their <hi>observing and doing of all whatever</hi> He <hi>hath commanded</hi> in the <hi>Worship</hi> of God, as <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 18; <hi>who is faithfull as a Son</hi> in and over the whole House of God.</p>
               <p>Besides it is acknowledged by all, and we shall (God willing) shew the <hi>Manner</hi> of it in our Exposition of the <hi>seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews,</hi> that the Lord Christ in and by the Gospel, hath altered and abolished all that <hi>Solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> all those Ordinances and Institutions which God himself had set up under the Old Testament, to continue unto the <hi>time of Reformation.</hi> And hereby he rendred it absolutely <hi>unlawfull</hi> for any one to serve God according unto those Institutions. Hereunto God signally set his publick Seal of Approbation in the sight of the World. For no sooner had the Lord Christ by the <hi>Promulgation of the Gospel</hi> taken away all their Authority and Obligatory <hi>power,</hi> so as that his Disciples ought not to make use of them any longer; but that God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by severe and unparallel'd Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments destroyed <hi>the Seat and Place</hi> of them, so that those who <hi>would,</hi> yet never <hi>could</hi> Regularly make use of them unto this Day. And shall we think that the Lord
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:204232:268"/> Jesus Christ thus took away and <hi>abolished</hi> the <hi>old solemn Worship of the Church,</hi> and substituted <hi>none</hi> in the room of it? Or that he took away that which was erected by the <hi>Wisdom of God,</hi> though but for a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and left the Church as to its main <hi>Duty</hi> and principal <hi>End</hi> in this World, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Inventions</hi> and <hi>Imaginations</hi> of Men? One of these must be supposed, if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that he hath established a <hi>solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of God, to continue unalterably unto the End of the World; and both of them are highly Blasphemous. Again, let any in Faith and Obedience unto him, <hi>practise</hi> and attend unto all those parts of <hi>Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> which he hath appointed, and I am perswaded no Man will have the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to say, that there is this or that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to render it <hi>a solemn</hi> and acceptable Service; however they may contend for the <hi>conveniency</hi> of some <hi>circumstantial Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionals.</hi> Wherefore, I take it for granted at present, that the Lord Jesus Christ hath appointed such a <hi>solemn Worship</hi> under the Gospel, which all his Disciples are obliged constantly and invariably to observe, as he declares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. And with respect hereunto Men may <hi>fall away</hi> and Apostatize from the Gospel, no less <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi>
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:204232:268"/> and <hi>fatally</hi> than they may fall from the <hi>Mystery</hi> of its <hi>Doctrine</hi> or the <hi>Holiness</hi> of its <hi>Precepts.</hi> And there are two wayes whereby this may be done. (1) By <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting</hi> and <hi>refusing</hi> to <hi>observe and doe</hi> what he hath <hi>appointed.</hi> (2) By <hi>adding Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of our own thereunto, inconsistent with and destructive of that which he hath ordained.</p>
               <p n="1">I. In the first way we have some among our selves who are fallen off from the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of the Gospel. It is true, they will doe <hi>some things</hi> which have an Appearance of being what he hath <hi>commanded.</hi> Such are their <hi>First-dayes Meeting</hi> and their <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> with <hi>speaking</hi> in them. But they neither observe the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> nor <hi>pray</hi> or <hi>speak</hi> in Obedience unto any Institution of his. <hi>Conveniency</hi> and the <hi>Light within</hi> are all the Reason and Guide which they plead for them. And for the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi> and <hi>the Supper of the Lord,</hi> which are so great a part of the <hi>Mystical Worship</hi> of the Church, on I know not what fond Pretences, they utterly reject. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they deal with a stated <hi>Ministry</hi> as of <hi>Christs Appointment,</hi> although they have found out Means to set up <hi>one</hi> of their own.</p>
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:204232:269"/>
               <p> And because herein also Christ is put <hi>unto open shame,</hi> we shall briefly enquire into the Grounds and Reasons of this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> from the Obedience due to his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Now the <hi>principal Reason</hi> (and which comprizeth all others) why some men have <hi>forsaken</hi> the Gospel as unto the <hi>Administration of its Ordinances,</hi> is, because they are no way suited unto, nor indeed consistent with that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> which they have betaken themselves unto. For the Ordinances of the Gospel are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations</hi> of the things which we Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and <hi>Means</hi> of the Conveyance of their Efficacy unto us. Unto the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that <hi>Faith,</hi> and our <hi>Edification</hi> therein, are they suited, and to nothing else. Now these Persons having fallen (as we have shewed) from the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Gospel in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of it, and the <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Obedience</hi> which it doth require, of what use can the Ordinances of <hi>Worship</hi> be unto them? For Instance; The Ordinance of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is instituted in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Death of Christ,</hi> of his <hi>suffering</hi> in our stead, of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> he made of himself therein, of the <hi>Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with God that he
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:204232:269"/> wrought, and of the <hi>sealing</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> with his <hi>Blood.</hi> To what end should any man solemnly <hi>worship</hi> God in and by this Ordinance, who upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter believeth none of these things, at least doth not Believe them as proposed in the Gospel, namely, as the <hi>principal Causes</hi> and <hi>Springs</hi> of Life, Righteousness and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Those who believe in God thorough these things, who find the Effects of them upon their Souls in Righteousness and Peace, cannot but delight to be found in the Exercise of <hi>Faith</hi> through this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as they know it to be their Duty so to doe. But it is apparent, that neither this nor the other Ordinance of <hi>Baptisme</hi> do contribute any thing to the Furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Encrease, or Establishment of that <hi>Light within Men,</hi> which upon the matter they resolve their Faith and Obedience into. Yea they are in their true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Notion, as both directing unto the <hi>sanctifying</hi> and <hi>justifying</hi> Blood of Christ, <hi>diametrically</hi> opposite thereunto, and unto what is ascribed unto it. It is therefore so far from being <hi>strange</hi> that these Men should forsake these Ordinances of <hi>Gospel Worship,</hi> that the Admission of them in their true and proper <hi>use</hi> and <hi>signification,</hi>
                  <pb n="516" facs="tcp:204232:270"/> is destructive of the whole <hi>Scheme of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> which they have formed unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Where the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Gospel is forsaken, the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> must be so too, and so all instituted <hi>Divine Service</hi> be neglected, or other things found out that may suit unto the <hi>Imaginations</hi> whereunto Men are turned aside.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Another Reason hereof hath been want of <hi>spiritual Light</hi> to see through the Veils of <hi>outward Institutions,</hi> and of the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> to obtain <hi>Communion</hi> with God in Christ by them. Our Worship un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Gospel</hi> is either absolutely <hi>spiritual,</hi> or that which comes immediately unto what is so. But in these Institutions there is somewhat that is <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>sensible;</hi> And it is to be feared that many do rest in these <hi>outward</hi> things, and proceed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Worship of God</hi> by them, than the Actions and Words that are used will carry them: But they are (as appointed by Christ) <hi>Animae Vehicula,</hi> Means of leading and conveying the Soul unto an <hi>intimate Communion</hi> with God. That they may be so unto us, three things are required.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we submit our Souls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences unto the <hi>Authority of Christ</hi> in these Institutions. Unless this be the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:204232:270"/> which we build upon, the whole Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice will be <hi>lost</hi> unto us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we rest on the <hi>Veracity of Christ</hi> for the working of the Grace and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the Mercy represented in them, and Sacramentally exhibited by them. For they will not profit them by whom the <hi>Promises</hi> of Christ (virtually contained in them and accompanying of them,) are not <hi>mixed with Faith;</hi> and we cannot believe the <hi>Promise,</hi> unless we submit to the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of Christ in the Appointment of that whereunto it is annexed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we <hi>understand</hi> in some measure the <hi>Mystical Relation</hi> that is between the <hi>outward Symbols</hi> of the Ordinance and the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> himself, with his <hi>Grace</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented thereby, wherein the Nature, Use and End of the Institutions are contained. And all these are necessary to keep up any <hi>delight</hi> in them, or a Conscientious <hi>use</hi> of them. Where therefore all these are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (as apparently they are in those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom we treat, being none of them either understood, owned, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by them; whereas they have neither <hi>spiritual Light</hi> into the internal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of these things, nor <hi>spiritual Gifts</hi> for their Administration unto Edification, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. There is <hi>another Way</hi> whereby Men may, and many Men do <hi>fall away,</hi> and have for <hi>many Ages</hi> fallen away from the <hi>Gospel</hi> with respect unto its <hi>Worship;</hi> and that is, by rejecting its <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>pure Institutions,</hi> substituting a <hi>Superstitious</hi> yea <hi>Idolatrous Worship</hi> of their own in the room thereof; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. For whereas there are various <hi>degrees</hi> of Declension from the <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Gospel Worship,</hi> according as Men <hi>forsake</hi> any part of it, or make any <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of their own unto it, yet at present I shall mention Them only by whom it is wholly <hi>perverted,</hi> that is, those of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> For as they have added unto it <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Institutions</hi> of their own, in great number, partly <hi>Superstitious</hi> and partly <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous,</hi> so there is no one <hi>Ordinance</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of Christ which they have not <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,</hi> the most of them so far, as utterly to destroy their Nature and Use. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as therefore the Lord Jesus Christ doth in the <hi>Ordinances of Gospel Worship,</hi> and the due
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:204232:271"/> Celebration of them, represent his own <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> unto the Church; to remove them out of the way, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce another <hi>Fabrick</hi> of them of another <hi>Constitution,</hi> is to represent <hi>Antichrist</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, and not <hi>Christ;</hi> and thereby to put Christ unto <hi>open shame.</hi> The Ways and Means whereby this <hi>Apostasie</hi> was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, by the Craft of Sathan and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Interest of Men, in a long Tract of Time, I shall not here declare: It shall suffice at present to observe, That as Men grew <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> having lost the Spirit, Life and Power of the Gospel, and so far as they did so, they found it necessary to introduce a <hi>carnal visible pompous</hi> Worship, suited unto that inward Principle and Light whereby they were acted. And as the People in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi> being <hi>carnal</hi> in their Hearts, and accustomed unto <hi>carnal</hi> wayes of Worship, upon the Absence of <hi>Moses</hi> in the Mount, cryed out unto <hi>Aaron, Make us Gods that may goe before us,</hi> (that is, Gods visibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,) <hi>for as for this man Moses we know not what is become of him,</hi> whereupon they made <hi>a Calf;</hi> so these Men finding the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of <hi>Mosaical Institutions,</hi> consisting in outward Images and Representations of Things, taken away, and themselves left (as
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:204232:272"/> it were) without any <hi>present Gods</hi> to guide them, that is, <hi>visible Representations</hi> of the Presence of God as their carnal Hearts and Minds might delight in, they provided all those <hi>Calves</hi> whereof their present <hi>Worship</hi> doth consist. And because there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in those dayes when this Design was first set on foot, who were <hi>truely spiritual and holy,</hi> worshipping God <hi>in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> this <hi>Idolatrous Worship</hi> could not be introduced and preserved but by <hi>insensible Degrees,</hi> and in a long Tract of Time; throughout the whole whereof the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> wrought effectually unto the same certain End. Those in the mean time who worshipped God in <hi>Truth</hi> were either imposed on, by a shew of Humility and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in the <hi>degrees of Apostasie</hi> which were added in their dayes, or else complained of what they could not remedy.</p>
               <p>And if these <hi>Brief Considerations</hi> of the Nature of the <hi>present Apostasie</hi> that is in the World from the <hi>Power</hi> of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in all the principal <hi>Concerns</hi> of it, with the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Occasions</hi> thereof, do excite or provoke any who hath more Leisure and Ability for this Work, unto a more diligent and usefull Enquiry into them, it will be an ample Reward unto my Endeavours.</p>

               <head type="sub">Inferences from the foregoing Discourses. The present Danger of all sorts of Persons in the Prevalency of Apostasie from the Truth, and Decayes in the Practice of Evangelical Holiness.</head>
               <p>THE last part of this Discourse is designed for <hi>Cautions</hi> unto those who yet <hi>stand,</hi> or <hi>think they stand,</hi> with respect unto that general <hi>Defection from the Gospel,</hi> whose Causes and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions we have thus far enquired into. And thereunto some Directions may be added, to be used as Preventives of its Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Method</hi> are we guided unto by the Apostle, who having declared the <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> and <hi>Ruine</hi> which ensued thereon of the Generality of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the Consideration of it unto the <hi>Caution</hi> of others, under a present Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Truth. <hi>Thou wilt say then,</hi>
                  <pb n="522" facs="tcp:204232:273"/> (saith he to the Gentile Believers,) <hi>the Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted on. Well, because of Ʋnbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by Faith; be not high-minded, but fear. For if God spared not the Natural Branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the Goodness and Severity of God; on them which fell, Severity; but towards thee, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if thou continue in his Goodness; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise thou also shalt be cut off; Rom.</hi> 11. 19, 20, 21, 22. And in another place on an alike Occasion, he speaks unto the same purpose; <hi>Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Most men are apt to suppose, that the Continuance of the True Religion in any place, depends solely on the <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Industry</hi> of those unto whom the Conduct of its Outward Concerns are committed. The <hi>Interest</hi> of some and the <hi>Duty</hi> of others in the Management of Humane Laws and Constitutions, are generally looked on as a sufficient and the <hi>onely</hi> Means of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. And those of this Perswasion think they have <hi>personally</hi> no Concernment herein, but only to <hi>herd</hi> themselves in the Multitude, and to take their Fate, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be. Such as these will despise our <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
                  <pb n="523" facs="tcp:204232:273"/> as those from which the Reasons and Confidences of their Fears are most remote. But whereas the <hi>Profession</hi> of Religion in the Community of Christians, will not be preserved but by the <hi>Power</hi> of it in <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals,</hi> the onely Root whereon it will long thrive or grow; we shall not at all concern our selves in them by whom the Directions of their Duty are thought <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> or <hi>useless.</hi> For after the utmost exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of <hi>Humane Policy,</hi> it is the <hi>Wisdom that is from above</hi> which must be our <hi>Stability.</hi> And if the <hi>Power</hi> of Truth and Holiness be not preserved in the Hearts and Lives of <hi>particular Persons,</hi> the <hi>Profession</hi> of them in <hi>Churches,</hi> or the <hi>pretence</hi> of them in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> (which are all that will remain,) are neither Acceptable unto <hi>God,</hi> nor Usefull unto the Souls of <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some think themselves, as for their own part, little concerned in these things. That there is such a <hi>Defection</hi> from the Gospel as hath been complained of, they cannot deny; and they will also grant, that it is desperately <hi>pernitious</hi> unto them that are overtaken thereby. Therefore they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it not amiss, that <hi>Men should be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> of its Danger, and directed to avoid it. But this they think necessary for <hi>others,</hi>
                  <pb n="524" facs="tcp:204232:274"/> not for <hi>themselves.</hi> For as for their part, they have not the like Occasions, nor are exposed unto the same Temptations with them who formerly Apostatized from the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or are in danger now so to doe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they know well enough what are their own <hi>Resolutions;</hi> and that though all Men should forsake either the <hi>Doctrine</hi> taught in, or the <hi>Obedience</hi> required by the <hi>Gospel,</hi> yet should their Constancy be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable. But I do not think these Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions sufficient to render our <hi>Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> needless. <hi>Occasions</hi> and <hi>Temptations</hi> are not in our power. Our greatest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Freedom from them, will not secure us from the Assaults of the next Hour. <hi>Peter</hi> foresaw not his <hi>Dangers</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> when he so confidently engaged into <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy</hi> in the Profession of his Master, which yet within a few Hours came upon him. And such is the Subtilty of our spiritual Adversary, that sometimes we are under the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Temptation</hi> when we think our selves most remote from it. It is beyond the Compass of <hi>Humane Reason</hi> to take at once a Prospect of all the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> thereof, with the wayes of its Efficacy and Prevalency. And if at any time we judge our selves free from an <hi>hour of Temptation,</hi>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:204232:274"/> which comes on the World to trye them that dwell therein, which most are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised with, and many are prevailed on by, so as to be secure and regardless of the <hi>Means</hi> of our Preservation, of all men we are in the most danger to be <hi>ruined</hi> by it. Neither will the best of our <hi>Resolutions</hi> be of any avail without the utmost of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</hi> The great Apostle thought and resolved with respect unto the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, that he would neither <hi>deny him</hi> nor <hi>forsake him;</hi> And if this Confidence did not <hi>betray</hi> him into his <hi>Fall,</hi> yet to be sure it did not <hi>preserve</hi> him from it; And it was upon his own Experience that he gave afterwards that holy Advice, that we should <hi>give a Reason of the Hope that is in us with Meekness and Fear,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14, 15; and <hi>pass the whole time of our sojourning here in Fear;</hi> Chap. 1. 17. The highest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Confidences</hi> have ever proved the most deceiving <hi>Presages</hi> of future <hi>stability.</hi> Wherefore, the utmost I design in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing <hi>Cautions,</hi> is but to excite men unto a due Apprehension of their <hi>Danger,</hi> that they be not surprized into that pernitious Security, which is the <hi>Mire wherein this Rush doth grow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Consideration of the <hi>Extent</hi> and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:204232:275"/> almost <hi>Ʋniversality</hi> of this <hi>Apostasie</hi> may be of Use unto this purpose. Ignorance, Prophaneness, Worldly-mindedness, with Sensuality of Life, have obtained the most eminent <hi>Catholicisme</hi> in <hi>Christendome.</hi> The Complaint of the Prophet is not unsuited to the present State thereof. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6; <hi>Ah sinfull Nation, a People laden with Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, a Seed of evil Doers, Children that are Corrupters, they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy one of Israel unto Anger; they are gone away backward. The whole Head is sick, and the whole Heart faint, from the sole of the Foot even unto the Head there is no Soundess in it, but Wounds and Bruises and putrifying Sores.</hi> Do we hear but of this or that <hi>individual Person</hi> who hath Apostatized from a Profession of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> in a sensual wicked worldly Course of Life, or is turned from the <hi>Faith</hi> into pernitious Errors, there is no Man that is wise and carefull of his Eternal Concerns, but he will take it as a <hi>Warning</hi> to examine, trye, and be carefull of himself. And this Counsel is laid before us by the Apostle; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18, 19. What then is required of us, when we see <hi>Nations, Churches,</hi> Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of People by one Means or other, degenerated from that <hi>Power of Godliness</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:204232:275"/> which once they professed. If we hear that one or other in a City is visited with the <hi>Plague,</hi> we are not altogether unsensible of our own <hi>Concern</hi> and <hi>Danger,</hi> because we know how usual it is for the <hi>Infection</hi> of that Disease to spread and diffuse it self. But if the <hi>whole City</hi> be infected, and <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands</hi> fall under it every Week, there is none so sottish as to need much warning of their Danger. And shall we be less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for our <hi>immortal Souls</hi> and their Eternal Condition, than we are for these <hi>frail Carcases</hi> and their Continuance for a few dayes in the World, which if they escape one Distemper, may yet in a few Moments fall under the Power of another? This <hi>spiritual Pestilence</hi> that hath formerly <hi>walked in Darkness,</hi> is now a Destruction wasting at <hi>Noon-day.</hi> Nations are depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by it, and Cities left desolate, as unto their Interest in God and the Gospel. And is it not high time to look diligently lest the Infection reach unto <hi>us</hi> also, lest We also should <hi>fail and come short of the Grace of God,</hi> and be <hi>hardened through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Sin.</hi> As then our <hi>Bodies</hi> are of the same Natural Frame and Constitution; as they have in them the same Humours, the same kind of Animal Spirits as are in
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:204232:276"/> those who are infected with the Plague, whereby we are obnoxious unto the same Infection with them; so there are in our <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Minds</hi> the same Principles of Sin and Love of the World, as are infected, drawn away, enticed, excited and enraged by outward Occasions and Temptations, untill they have issued in <hi>Apostasie.</hi> Do we think that we shall be alwayes easily preserved (and that whilest we are <hi>careless</hi> and secure,) from that Torrent which hath carryed away such Multitudes before it? Are we in our selves <hi>better than they</hi> or any of them? Have we a <hi>Patent</hi> for our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, whilest we neglect any Wayes, Means, or Diligence that the <hi>Rule</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thereunto? Doth not God shew unto us, not <hi>one</hi> but <hi>many</hi> Churches and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, saying, <hi>Goe unto those Shilo's where I sometimes placed my Name, and see what is become of them, and what I have done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them?</hi> Will you goe after them, have you a Mind to be made like unto them? Think not to say within your selves, <hi>We have Abraham to our Father;</hi> We have those outward Priviledges and Advantages which they have not; for they also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the same untill they had forfeited them by their <hi>Apostasie.</hi> Certainly the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
                  <pb n="529" facs="tcp:204232:276"/> Prevalency of this Evil proclaims such a Danger, as no wise Man, no man that takes care of his own Salvation, ought or indeed can neglect. Wherefore, as it is alwayes with Christians, if ever it be a time to <hi>watch,</hi> to <hi>stand on our Guard,</hi> to <hi>take unto our selves the whole Armour of God,</hi> to be <hi>jealous</hi> of our selves, to be <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> in the use of all Means both <hi>private</hi> and <hi>publick</hi> for our Preservation, it is now a time so to be. And if Professors will not be awakened, if they will not stirre up themselves with the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> which they have received, if they will please themselves that all is well with them and is likely so to be; if they will yet immix themselves with Boldness and Confidence in the Wayes of the World; Oh that my Head were a Fountain of <hi>tears!</hi> Oh that my Soul could mourn in secret for them! seeing assuredly they will not be able to stand in that <hi>Day of Temptation</hi> which is come upon the Face of the Earth, to <hi>trye</hi> them that dwell therein. The <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court</hi> is long since given to be <hi>trodden down by the Gentiles,</hi> and how soon the Enemies may roar in the very <hi>Sanctuaries,</hi> and <hi>set up their Banners for Tokens,</hi> we know not; For,</p>
               <pb n="530" facs="tcp:204232:277"/>
               <p> 2<seg rend="sup">dly</seg>, The present State of this <hi>Defection</hi> hath a dangerous <hi>Aspect.</hi> Physitians say, <hi>Nemo moritur in Declinatione Morbi;</hi> No man dyes in the Declension of his Disease. And when a publick <hi>pestilential Distemper</hi> is in its Wane or Decay, the Danger is esteemed in a great measure over. But whilest a <hi>Disease</hi> is yet <hi>growing</hi> and daily <hi>spreading</hi> its Contagion, whilest the <hi>Bills of Mortality</hi> are every Week <hi>encreased,</hi> they are onely <hi>hardened</hi> and <hi>profligate</hi> Persons whom the <hi>Commonness</hi> of the Judgement renders Regardless and senseless of it. And it is no otherwise with the Evil complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of at this day. There is almost nothing in the World that <hi>all sober</hi> Men do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agree in, but this alone, <hi>That the whole World doth daily wax worse and worse.</hi> Who can give an Instance of the <hi>Decrease</hi> or <hi>Abatement</hi> of any one Sin, in its Love or Practice? but that some are advanced to higher Degrees of Confidence in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration, than former Dayes or Ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us any President of, every one can declare. What Instances have we of a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Recovery</hi> from any of our Decayes? What Attempts unto that purpose are made by any, unless by such as are not of Consideration, as have not Advantages
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:204232:277"/> to enable them to Effect any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? The World is highly at variance about <hi>Religion,</hi> mannaging its Differences with great Animosities and Industry, how one Way, Party and Profession, may draw persons from other Wayes and Professions. The sole Business of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> is by all manner of <hi>Artifices</hi> to win over men unto their Communion; that is, a Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Souls, Consciences, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Interests, here and for Eternity, to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Pope.</hi> Others bestirre themselves as well as they are able, to keep what they have, and to rescue Men from their Seductions. And yet although they have the Advantage of the <hi>Truth</hi> on their side, and for the most part the Advantage of <hi>Abilities</hi> in the mannagement of their Cause, yet they visibly lose ground every day; and where one is recovered from the <hi>Roman Interest,</hi> many are added unto it. And there can be no Reason assigned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but onely that the Apostasie is upon its Encrease, this being one way of it. Half that pains would have formerly turned an <hi>whole City</hi> from <hi>Popery,</hi> which will not now succeed unto the preservation of <hi>one Person.</hi> But in the mean time, both in one Profession and another, all sorts of men
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:204232:278"/> continue regardless of <hi>Gospel-Holiness</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> And whilest they quarrel about the <hi>outward Form,</hi> the <hi>inward power</hi> of <hi>Godliness</hi> lyes neglected. Do we see things any where in the World upon a <hi>Recovery,</hi> or any thriving Design for the Retrival of <hi>Holiness?</hi> The Name and Thing are growing more and more into Contempt. What Instance can be given wherein this <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the <hi>Gospel</hi> doth or may exert it self, be it in <hi>Atheisme,</hi> be it in <hi>Popery,</hi> in hatred of and scoffing at the <hi>Mysteries of Evangelical Truth,</hi> in Worldliness, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness, Vanity, and Sensuality of Life; in the Coldness in Love, and Barrenness among Professors, that is not openly in its <hi>progress?</hi> And is this a time to be <hi>secure, careless,</hi> or <hi>negligent?</hi> Are we sure that this <hi>Epidemical Infection</hi> shall not enter our Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations? Do we not find how it hath one way or other attempted us already? Can we find no decay in <hi>Zeal</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> among our selves, no Adherence unto the World unsuited unto our present State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in it; No neglect of <hi>Duties,</hi> no Rareness in Divine <hi>Visitations,</hi> no want of <hi>Life</hi> and Delight in <hi>spiritual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with Christ, no hurtfull Growth of carnal Wisdom, with all its Attendants?
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:204232:278"/> Or have we not found our selves one way or other sensibly attacqued by these Evils? It is to be feared that those who can make no Observation of any thing of this Nature among themselves, are somewhat sick of the <hi>Laodicean</hi> distemper. And if we will not be awakened and stirred up to a more than ordinary Diligence, Care and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness at such a season as this is, it is to be feared that ere long the Generality of Professors will come to be in the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>Sardis, to have a Name to live,</hi> but indeed and in the sight of Christ <hi>to be dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>, As this <hi>Apostasie</hi> is yet in its <hi>progress,</hi> so what will be its <hi>Event,</hi> what it will arise unto, is altogether uncertain. God can put a stop unto it when he pleaseth, as he hath in his holy Purposes fixed Bounds unto it which it shall not pass. But in the mean time being greatly provoked by the <hi>Ingratitude</hi> of a wicked World, no man knows how long he may suspend those more powerfull Influences and more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Effects of his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which are needfull unto the <hi>healing of the Nations,</hi> and without which they will not be <hi>cured.</hi> I hope for better things, and pray for better things, but I have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:204232:279"/> Ground of Assurance that this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie shall not <hi>grow,</hi> untill in one Instance or other of it, it swallow up all <hi>visible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi> The whole World, so far as I know of, (I mean these parts of it,) may become <hi>Papal</hi> again, or be so <hi>corrupted</hi> in their <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> and <hi>prophane in their Lives,</hi> as that it is no great matter what their <hi>Profession</hi> in Religion be. Two things I do know or believe; namely, (1) That <hi>the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God standeth sure, having this Seal, God knoweth who are his;</hi> His Elect, that truely <hi>fear</hi> him, and diligently <hi>serve</hi> him, shall be preserved from <hi>perishing eternally,</hi> and every thing that necessarily leads there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. (2) That God hath appointed a <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>season,</hi> wherein he will not only put a <hi>stop</hi> unto this <hi>Defection</hi> from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, but an <hi>end</hi> also. He will one day execute the Vengeance that he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and recorded, on the Throne, Power and Kingdom of the <hi>Antichristian Apostasie,</hi> and in <hi>one day</hi> shall the Plagues of <hi>Babylon</hi> come upon her; And <hi>he will again turn to the People a pure Language, that they may all call on the Name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent; Zeph.</hi> 3. 9, 10. He will again <hi>revive</hi> the Beauty of his <hi>Worship,</hi> and the Glory of <hi>Holiness</hi> in the Earth.
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:204232:279"/> But in the mean time what things may come unto, I know not. Those who pretend to a clearer Inspection into <hi>future things,</hi> may not do amiss strictly to examine the <hi>Grounds</hi> whereon they proceed. For many have been made <hi>ashamed</hi> of their Predictions that within such or such a Time the <hi>Yoke of Babylon should be broken.</hi> This is all I say, (and I say it only for my self,) I know no Assurance that can be given on infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Grounds, that the <hi>Apostasie</hi> which we are treating of, shall not one way or other, in one Instance or other, become again to be <hi>Catholick,</hi> and prevail against all open visible Profession of the Purity and Power of <hi>Gospel-Worship</hi> and <hi>Holiness.</hi> Now if this be not so unto others, yet unto my self it ought to be a Warning, how I may be thought <hi>worthy to escape,</hi> and to <hi>stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son of Man.</hi> And I am sure, there is so much danger of it at least, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Consideration of all who take care of their Eternal Salvation. For if things should come to such a pass, they are not many, they are but <hi>very few</hi> who will be <hi>entirely</hi> preserved. The most will one way or other <hi>suffer loss.</hi> And it is not an easie thing to be found among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>few</hi> in such a season. Can we
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:204232:280"/> think that men careless in holy Duties, cold in Zeal, lukewarm in Love, barren in good Works, cleaving to the World, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto it, low in their Light, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious in their State, useless in the World, fearfull of Trials, will be of this number? They are wofully deceived who are pleased with such apprehensions; other Principles, other Wayes, Courses and Practices, will be required in them who shall be <hi>hidden</hi> and <hi>safeguarded</hi> in that Day.</p>
               <p>4<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>, The <hi>various Wayes</hi> whereby this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> prevails in the World, should also warn us to stand upon <hi>our Guard.</hi> Were it of <hi>one sort</hi> onely, did it work onely <hi>one way,</hi> or made use of <hi>one Engine</hi> alone for its Progress, the Evil and Danger of it might be the more easily either withstood or avoyded. But as we have before refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it unto three general Heads with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>Holiness</hi> and the <hi>Worship</hi> of the Gospel, so under each of them there are various Wayes and Means whereby it is promoted. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from this Plague is taken innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. Some take it in their Shops or <hi>especial Vocations,</hi> some in their <hi>Societies,</hi> Civil and Ecclesiastical, some from the <hi>Vanities and Pleasures,</hi> some from
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:204232:280"/> the <hi>Profits</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> of the World; Unbelief, the Deceitfulness of Sin, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Lusts and Affections, spiritual Sloth, Cares about, and Love of Riches, lye all in a Readiness to give Entertainment to, and to embrace any Opportunity Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or Means whatever it be, whereby this Apostasie may be admitted and take place in them. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12, 13. <hi>chap.</hi> 12. 15, 16, 17. Sathan in the mean time labours by his Insinuations to corrupt our Minds, to poyson our Lusts, and to supply them with all enveigling or provoking Objects. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 12. In this State of things look how many <hi>publick Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> there are in the World, so many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Wayes and Means are there whereby this Apostasie doth prevail; And who can reckon up these Temptations? Hence it is that men fall under this Evil such various Wayes, and unto such various Degrees; Some do so by <hi>Errors</hi> and damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, <hi>denying the Lord that bought them;</hi> some by <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry;</hi> some by a <hi>Contempt</hi> of Gospel Mysteries, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring another way of Duty before Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience; some by <hi>Ambition</hi> and Pride of Life, some by Love of the World, and a Neglect of Duties <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>moral</hi>
                  <pb n="538" facs="tcp:204232:281"/> under a deceiving Profession; some by suffering carnal <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and some sensual <hi>Lusts</hi> to devour their Convictions and their Efficacy; some by the <hi>Ʋncertainty</hi> of their Minds brought to an Indifferency in all things <hi>Supernatural</hi> and <hi>Divine;</hi> some by <hi>Vain-glory</hi> and <hi>Shame</hi> to be found among the scorned Society of those who are truely Religious; and Multitudes are initiated into an <hi>irrecoverable Prophaneness,</hi> by the vain Pomps and Spectacles of the Age; And other Wayes there are more than can be recounted, whereby this Evil is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and men fall under the <hi>power</hi> of it. By this Means the very common <hi>Aire</hi> we breath in, is infected, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33. <hi>Snakes</hi> are in all Grass whereon we tread, and <hi>Scorpions</hi> under every Stone. Snares are laid for us on every hand, and those (some of them) so gilded and set off, that Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of loose Professors have taken them up, and wear them as their Ornaments. Those who escape one Evil do every day fall into others. And how shall they escape who are encompassed with so many Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, if they live in the Neglect of any one <hi>Duty</hi> or Means of their Preservation, that God hath appointed and made usefull thereunto?</p>
               <pb n="539" facs="tcp:204232:281"/>
               <p> 5<seg rend="sup">thly</seg>, Consider, that there is an <hi>Apostasie</hi> which is <hi>irrecoverable;</hi> and it will end in <hi>Eternal Ruine.</hi> This is that which we are taught in this Context, according unto the Exposition before given of it. No man in this World can be by the Rule of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel in an <hi>unsaveable Condition,</hi> that is, be concluded under an unavoidable Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by any known Rule of the Revealed Will of God, unless it be an <hi>Apostate.</hi> There are also several sorts and Degrees of <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> that may have several Causes and Effects, and so various Events. Great Surprizals, strong Temptations, Negligence in Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the Deceitfulness of Sin, may produce <hi>Temporary Abnegations</hi> of Christ and the Gospel, wofull <hi>Declensions</hi> from the due Observation of his Commands, with wandring into foolish Opinions, and yet Persons be recovered from them all, and brought by Repentance unto Salvation. Signal Instances of this Grace and Patience in God might be given. And this is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to render the <hi>Despair</hi> of them cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, who are ever awakened in this World time enough to endeavour a Deliverance from any Sin or Course of Sinning provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and destructive. For when any man is by any Means called to have any thing
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:204232:282"/> to doe with God about his Eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, God doth not allow him to be the absolute <hi>Soveraign Judge</hi> of himself, which would usurp his Prerogative, and put the Sinner in the place of God. He that <hi>despairs,</hi> sayes, <hi>I am in the stead of God to my self in this matter; there is neither Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor Grace, nor Mercy in him but what I can comprehend.</hi> And this Evil God hath obviated in signal Instances of the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of great <hi>Apostates.</hi> But yet withall there is (as we have shewed) an <hi>Apostasie</hi> that is <hi>irrecoverable;</hi> and hereof God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits many Examples in this World, to put an Awe not onely on <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>presumptuous</hi> but also on <hi>careless</hi> and <hi>negligent</hi> Sinners. For whereas our Apostle doth expressely <hi>twice</hi> mind the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of this <hi>severity of God</hi> against Apostates, in this place, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 26, 27; in the one he doth it with respect unto <hi>unprofitableness</hi> under the Means of Grace, and in the other unto a <hi>Negligence</hi> in attending unto the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Gospel <hi>Ordinances.</hi> Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as any men may be overtaken with the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Decayes</hi> and Declensions from the <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> of the Gospel, all which have a Tendency in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto this <hi>irrecoverable Apostasie,</hi> ought
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:204232:282"/> they not to be continually <hi>jealous</hi> over themselves, lest they should pass the Bounds God hath fixed unto his <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Grace?</hi> Ought we not to be carefull about every Sin or Omission of Duty that hath a tendency unto this dolefull Issue? For this very End, that we may be warned to take heed of the <hi>Beginning of Apostasie,</hi> doth the Apostle in this place declare the <hi>End</hi> of it. The <hi>Reader</hi> may if he please (to help him herein) consult our Discourses on <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. It is not an easie Task to stop a <hi>Course in Backsliding</hi> when once it is entred into. And I shall close this Warning with naming two Directions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this purpose. (1) <hi>Take heed of a Course in any Sin.</hi> Though every Sin doth not immediately tend unto Final Apostasie, yet <hi>a Course in any Sin</hi> continued, doth so. (2) <hi>Take heed of</hi> touching on such <hi>especial Sins</hi> as have a peculiar Tendency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and of what Nature they are, hath been declared.</p>
               <p>6<seg rend="sup">thly</seg>, Our last Consideration of this Kind shall be taken from the <hi>Nature and Guilt</hi> of this Sin, wherever it be found, with the <hi>Severity</hi> of God against it. And we may look upon it as it is <hi>Total,</hi> such as that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. The
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:204232:283"/> Exposition we have given of the words, will warrant us to conclude, that <hi>Total Apostasie from the Gospel once professed, is a greater Sin, and of a more heynous Nature than that of the Jews in Crucifying the Lord Christ in the dayes of his Flesh.</hi> This was sufficiently proved in the Exposition of the words. It remains only that we do briefly enquire what doth concurre unto such a <hi>Total Apostasie,</hi> whereby the Truth of the <hi>Exposition</hi> and the Necessity of the <hi>Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> given, will be made yet more Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And though I shall speak with espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial respect unto <hi>total</hi> Apostasie from all <hi>Profession,</hi> yet are the things that shall be spoken, to be found in their <hi>degree</hi> and <hi>measure</hi> in all those who are guilty of that <hi>partial Defection</hi> which we have described. There are therefore alwayes found in this <hi>great Offence</hi> the things ensuing.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The <hi>loss of all Taste of any Goodness or Excellency in the Gospel,</hi> in the Truth or State of its <hi>Profession</hi> and <hi>Worship.</hi> There is no man who hath ever made a <hi>Profession</hi> of the Gospel in <hi>Earnest,</hi> beyond Pretence and Custom, but he hath found some kind of <hi>Taste,</hi> Relish or Sweetness in the things of it. They <hi>taste of the good Word of God,</hi> and <hi>the Powers of the World to come;</hi> either
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:204232:283"/> in the things themselves, or in the Manner of their Dispensation, or of the Duties of Worship enjoyned therein, they have found somewhat that hath given their <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> some Satisfaction. A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not goe into a <hi>pleasant Garden</hi> in the Spring, but he will smell <hi>some savour</hi> from the <hi>Flowers,</hi> though he gather not one of them. A man cannot take <hi>Meat savoury</hi> and well condited into his Mouth, but he will <hi>taste the Relish of it,</hi> though he have no Mind nor Appetite to eat it. Nor can any man <hi>walk</hi> in the <hi>Sun,</hi> but he will have some Impressions from its <hi>Heat.</hi> It is so, it can be no otherwise with them who live under the <hi>Preaching of the Gospel</hi> and make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of its <hi>Doctrine.</hi> More or less it will insinuate it self into their Minds with <hi>a Taste of its Excellency</hi> and <hi>Goodness.</hi> This in the Case considered is <hi>lost</hi> in the first place. And generally it comes to pass by a <hi>Love of Sin</hi> and <hi>Pleasures</hi> of the World. When this hath filled and possessed the Soul, all its Sences grow <hi>dead</hi> unto <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> things, it hath no Faculty or Ability to <hi>taste</hi> any Relish in them; yea it loaths and abhorres them as contrary to what it hath immersed it self in, or given up it self unto. This usually is <hi>lost</hi> in the first place;
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:204232:284"/> such Persons find nothing any longer in Christ or the Gospel, for which they should either <hi>delight</hi> in them or <hi>desire</hi> them; And it seems to be thus with so many in the World, who once gave hopes of better things, that the Consideration of it is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) This is quickly followed with <hi>a loss of all prevailing Evidence and Conviction of the Truth of the very Doctrine of the Gospel.</hi> This Conviction all are supposed to have who profess it, and all really have it who profess it in any sincerity. Why else doe they make Profession of it, if they assent not unto its <hi>Truth</hi> upon its Conviction and Evidence. For we speak not at all of them whose Profession hath no other Principle or Foundation but <hi>Custom</hi> or <hi>Education.</hi> Others build their Perswasion upon <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Evidences</hi> prevalent to obtain their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto the Truth against Temptations and Objections; This <hi>Apostates</hi> lose in the next place. The <hi>Truth</hi> remains what it was, and so do the Arguments and Evidences of it, but they have no longer any Force upon, or <hi>Authority</hi> in their Minds. It may be they do not presently renounce the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel as <hi>a Lye,</hi> or a cunningly <hi>devised Fable;</hi> They may let the <hi>Notions</hi> of it lye loose in
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:204232:284"/> their Minds for a season neglected and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded, but give them no part of that Entertainment which is due unto acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Truths of that Nature, nor do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any <hi>Impressions</hi> from its <hi>Authority.</hi> And when men have lost these, they have lost their Assent to the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Gospel upon its proper Evidence, and are directly <hi>Ʋnbelievers.</hi> And this on every Occasion will issue in a <hi>formal Renunciation</hi> of the Truth of the whole. And when Men ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive unto this Posture in their <hi>Minds,</hi> they will discover themselves, as by a <hi>Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> wholly regardless of the Precepts of Christ, so also by light irreverent Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which (where they have Freedom) will be poured out from the Abundance of their Hearts. This step towards <hi>total Apostasie</hi> will follow that foregoing. When once Men have lost all Taste and Relish of the <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of the Word of God on their Hearts and Affections, they will not long retain any prevalent <hi>Evidence</hi> of its <hi>Truth</hi> in their Minds. Hence,</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>A Contempt of the things promised in the Gospel doth ensue.</hi> The Promises of the Gospel do indeed contain those things wherein the evident <hi>Blessedness</hi> and <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:204232:285"/> of our Natures doth consist. Such is <hi>Serenity</hi> of Mind in this World, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Felicity</hi> in the Enjoyment of God. These (for the substance of them) Mankind cannot despise untill they grow <hi>Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Brutish.</hi> But they may, and many do so, in the <hi>manner</hi> and on the Terms of their Proposal and Declaration by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> of the Gospel. That this Enjoyment of God (wherein <hi>Everlasting Happiness</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth,) must be in and through <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> alone, that the Way of attaining thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the onely Means of present <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Serenity</hi> of Mind, is by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> in and unto him, this they <hi>despise</hi> and <hi>contemn.</hi> This naturally follows on the former; for all Expectation of Good by and from the <hi>Promises of the Gospel,</hi> depends on the <hi>Evidence</hi> that we have of the <hi>Truth</hi> thereof. And when <hi>that</hi> is lost, <hi>these</hi> will be despised. Now herein consisteth one of the greatest Aggravations of this Sin. For whereas men cannot but <hi>desire</hi> the things (for the substance of them) which are <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised</hi> in the Gospel, as those wherein their <hi>Blessedness</hi> doth consist; they will (out of Hatred to <hi>Jesus Christ,)</hi> reject and <hi>despise</hi> them, and Eternally deprive their Souls of them, rather than accept of them <hi>in</hi> and
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:204232:285"/>
                  <hi>through</hi> him: They will rather never have any Interest in <hi>God,</hi> than have it <hi>by Christ.</hi> This Rejection therefore of the <hi>Promises of the Gospel,</hi> as those which either as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of them are not to be <hi>desired,</hi> or as to the <hi>Truth</hi> of them not to be <hi>trusted,</hi> is the most provoking Sin. No greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach can possibly be cast on <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> as that which leaveth him the Honour neither of his <hi>Truth</hi> nor <hi>Power;</hi> neither of which the <hi>Jews</hi> could in the least impeach, when they took away his life. And,</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>They choose some other Way or Means in the place and stead of Christ and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, for the Ends which they once sought after by them.</hi> So did those Persons who fell off to <hi>Judaisme.</hi> They looked for that in the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Ceremonyes</hi> which they could not find in the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And of these there are two sorts; (1) Such as <hi>retain</hi> their <hi>first End</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> but reject the <hi>Gospel</hi> from being a <hi>sufficient Means</hi> for <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> it; (2) Some that <hi>renounce</hi> the <hi>whole End</hi> it self, and seek for <hi>satisfaction</hi> other wayes. The former are such as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve an Aym in general to <hi>worship God,</hi> to <hi>do</hi> that in Religion which may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by him, and to <hi>believe</hi> that of him which is <hi>right.</hi> But they reject the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
                  <pb n="548" facs="tcp:204232:286"/> as an <hi>insufficient</hi> and deceitfull Guide in and about these things. And this is done either <hi>totally,</hi> by such as Apostatize to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daisme</hi> or <hi>Mahumetisme;</hi> or <hi>partially,</hi> by such as turn off from the Purity, Truth, Spirituality and Mystery of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Popery,</hi> or the like. I say not this with an intention to charge the Guilt of this whole Sin on this latter sort; onely I say, they share in a very considerable part of it, and without <hi>Repentance</hi> will do so in the Punishment due unto it. And this casts the scorn of <hi>Folly</hi> on Christ and the Gospel, both <hi>absolutely</hi> as having neither Truth nor Efficacy sufficient for the End proposed by them, and <hi>comparatively,</hi> that a Falshood or Lye, a diabolical Invention or Delusion is to be preferred before them, which is the highest Provocation unto the Eyes of Gods Glory. The latter sort quite cast off the general End of <hi>pleasing God, and living unto him.</hi> For a while they thought that this would have brought them in some considerable Satisfaction, and used the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel to that End and Purpose. But now being fallen under the <hi>power</hi> of the former Degrees of <hi>Apostasie,</hi> in contempt of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as that which will not afford any tolerable answer unto their Expectations,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:204232:286"/> they take up in the Lusts and Pleasures of the World, preferring them before all the <hi>Promises of Christ,</hi> and despising all the Threatnings denounced against those that pursue them. And of this sort of <hi>Apostates</hi> we have numberless Examples in the World.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Hereunto is added, <hi>a perfect Hatred and Contempt of such as abide constant in their Adherence unto and Profession of the Gospel.</hi> Constant Observation hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the saying, <hi>Apostata est Osor sui Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis;</hi> Great Apostates have been alwayes great Persecutors in <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Deed</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Power. As those who <hi>love</hi> Christ, do <hi>love</hi> all that are his, <hi>because</hi> they are his; so they that <hi>hate</hi> him, do <hi>hate</hi> all that are his, <hi>because</hi> they are his. And their <hi>Hatred</hi> because it is against the whole Kind, acts it self every way possible. They <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise them</hi> as <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>foolish,</hi> for Adhering and trusting to the Things which they have Relinquished, trusting to themselves, their Reason and Gallantry of Spirit. They are filled with <hi>Revenge</hi> against them, as those who censure, judge, and condemn them as guilty of the highest <hi>Villany</hi> and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate <hi>Wickedness.</hi> They know in their Hearts that they have <hi>Reserves</hi> against them,
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:204232:287"/> as Persons whom their Lord will one day <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>destroy,</hi> which makes them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign (if it were possible) their utter <hi>Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation</hi> from the face of the Earth. Those who <hi>crucified Christ</hi> in his own Person, did it but <hi>once,</hi> and could do so no more; these do so every day; for what is done unto any of <hi>his,</hi> for <hi>his</hi> sake, he esteemeth as done unto himself. <hi>Why persecutest thou Me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">(6) These Persons who proceed thus far, do alwayes fall into a <hi>peculiar Contempt of the Spirit of God,</hi> and his whole Work in the <hi>Dispensation of the Gospel.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the <hi>Dispensation of the Spirit,</hi> is the especial <hi>Priviledge</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> He is sent and given in an especial manner by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> as <hi>exalted.</hi> His whole Work is to <hi>glorifie</hi> and <hi>exalt</hi> Jesus Christ, and to make his Mediation <hi>effectual</hi> unto the Souls of Men. And in the things which concern him and his Work, lyes the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of the Gospel. Hence those who Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize from it, have a peculiar <hi>Enmity</hi> against him and his Work. And this usually is one of the first things wherein the <hi>fatal Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings</hi> of Men do manifest themselves. When once men <hi>tread under foot the Son of God,</hi> and <hi>account the Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
                  <pb n="551" facs="tcp:204232:287"/>
                  <hi>wherewith he was sanctified, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy thing,</hi> (as they do in the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,) they will assuredly <hi>do despite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spirit of Grace; Heb.</hi> 10. 29. How this is done in particular, shall be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that place, if God will, and we live thereunto. Under this Head and Degree, the Sin of <hi>Apostasie</hi> becomes formally <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">(7) An <hi>open Profession of a Detestation of the Gospel,</hi> so far as it is consistent with their <hi>Worldly Interests</hi> and Advantages, compleats the <hi>Soul-ruining Sin</hi> we treat of. It may be they may live in such Times and Places, as that it would be to their Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Disadvantage openly to avow their <hi>Renunciation</hi> of Christ. But when that is the onely Curb from the Declaration of themselves, the Frame of their Minds is esteemed for a full Profession of their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie.</p>
               <p>Now whereas all these things (and it may be sundry others) do concurre unto this Sin of <hi>Apostasie,</hi> I shall conclude two things concerning it. (1) That it is <hi>a far greater Sin</hi> than that of the Generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> who <hi>crucified</hi> Jesus Christ in the dayes of his Flesh, as was before asserted. (2) That it is <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:204232:288"/> Righteousness, Honour and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, to <hi>Renew such Persons</hi> as are <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>openly</hi> Guilty hereof unto <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Repentance may be given unto <hi>them</hi> in Hell, with as much Advantage unto the Glory of God. For when men after <hi>Trial</hi> and <hi>Experiment,</hi> with some Convictions of its <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Excellency,</hi> do obstinately <hi>reject</hi> the onely Remedy and Relief that God hath provided for Sinners, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in do <hi>despight</hi> unto the whole <hi>Blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and each Person thereof in his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Interest in the <hi>Dispensation</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> of Grace, God neither in his <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> will, nor in his <hi>Holiness</hi> can have any thing more to doe with such presumptuous Sinners in a way of <hi>Mercy.</hi> He may and doth <hi>endure them</hi> for a while in this World, and that without any visible Tokens of his <hi>Indignation,</hi> satisfying his Justice in the <hi>spiritual Judgements</hi> that are upon them; but it is onely as <hi>Vessels of Wrath fitted to Destruction,</hi> and such whose <hi>Damnation sleepeth not.</hi> And these things may suffice to warn men of the <hi>Danger</hi> of this <hi>Evil;</hi> and they will be Warnings unto all who shall <hi>consider</hi> them, who are not hardened through the Deceitfulness of Sin; And all the Judgements of God, which are either
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:204232:288"/>
                  <hi>impendent</hi> over, or already <hi>inflicted</hi> on a wicked Apostatizing World, are <hi>Calls</hi> from Heaven unto a Consideration of them.</p>
               <p>Now although the Generality of men seem to be <hi>secure</hi> enough from any <hi>Trouble</hi> or Discomposure in their Minds from the Consideration of things of this Nature, yet some there are who may by their own Misapprehensions fall under such <hi>Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> as may hinder them in that Course of <hi>Obedience</hi> which they would pursue. I shall therefore divert a little, to prevent or remove the Objections which such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons make against themselves, and from whence their <hi>Discouragement</hi> doth arise, adding some <hi>Directions</hi> suited unto their State or Condition. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Some may suppose themselves so far interested in the <hi>Backsliding</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> described, as that the <hi>Threatning</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the Text doth belong unto them also; and that they are <hi>judicially</hi> now shut up under Impenitency. For, they say that they had attained unto a greater Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or Degree of <hi>Holiness,</hi> unto more Readiness, Evenness and Constancy in the Duties of <hi>Obedience</hi> than they do now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. They have fearfully and wofully fallen off from a <hi>better Frame,</hi> into Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:204232:289"/> Barrenness, Neglect of Duties, and it may be in some Instance into a <hi>sinfull Course,</hi> and that for many dayes. Hence now they fear, that lest as they are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that they have <hi>forsaken God</hi> and gone off from him, so he should <hi>forsake them</hi> utterly, and that they should be <hi>sealed up</hi> under Impenitency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. As this Case too often falls out, so it is often answered; and I shall not therefore much insist upon it, nor any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise but as our present design and Discourse is concerned therein. And I say,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) It is to be granted, that all such <hi>Backslidings</hi> are not onely <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>sinfull,</hi> but <hi>dangerous</hi> also, as to the Issue and Event. Whoever therefore finds himself under the <hi>power</hi> of them, or any way <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken</hi> by them, ought not onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Guilt of all the particular Sins and Omissions of Duties which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, but principally the <hi>whole State of their Souls,</hi> and the Danger they are in of being hardened through the Deceitfulness of Sin. For no man in such a State can have the least <hi>spiritual Assurance</hi> or secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that he shall not fall <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> from God; and whatever Perswasion he hath of that nature, it is but a <hi>deceiving</hi>
                  <pb n="555" facs="tcp:204232:289"/>
                  <hi>Presumption</hi> that will effectually promote his Apostasie and Ruine. For there is no Word of Truth, no Promise of God, to assure any of his Love and Favour whilest they are in such a State. It is therefore unquestionably the Duty of every one who is <hi>sensible</hi> of any Evil of this Nature, in the Frame of his Heart, or Course of his Life, to give himself no <hi>Rest</hi> therein, seeing the <hi>Eternal Welfare</hi> of his Soul is highly in question. But,</p>
               <p n="2">(2) There is a <hi>Decay,</hi> a <hi>Falling away</hi> from the <hi>Degrees of Holiness and Obedience</hi> that Men may have attained, and that it may be for a <hi>long season,</hi> and possibly with respect unto some <hi>especial Sin</hi> which is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable,</hi> and which doth not cast Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons under the <hi>power</hi> of it, <hi>absolutely</hi> into the Threatning here recorded. What <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> are required hereunto, and what <hi>Aggravations</hi> of Sin, hath been shewed in the Opening of the Words. Now there may be a <hi>falling away,</hi> and that great and dangerous, which yet riseth not up unto the Provocation of the Evil here in an <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner</hi> intended. And I judge it may be given as a safe Rule in General, That <hi>he who is spiritually sensible of the Evil of his Backsliding, is unquestionably in a recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
                  <pb n="556" facs="tcp:204232:290"/>
                  <hi>Condition;</hi> and some may be so who are not yet <hi>sensible</hi> thereof, so long as they are capable of being made so by <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> No man is past <hi>Hopes</hi> of Salvation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he is past all <hi>Possibility</hi> of Repentance. And no man is past all <hi>possibility</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, untill he be <hi>absolutely</hi> hardened against all <hi>Gospel Convictions.</hi> Wherefore there is a <hi>Recoverable Backsliding.</hi> For, (1) Christ <hi>calleth</hi> men unto such a <hi>Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which therefore he approves of, and will assist them therein who conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously apply themselves unto their Duty, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4; which latter Instance is great in this Kind. (2) God hath <hi>promised</hi> to <hi>recover</hi> and <hi>heal</hi> such Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings in Believers; <hi>Hosea</hi> 14. 4. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom this is not Encouragement suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to endeavour a <hi>Recovery</hi> of themselves, it is to be feared they will wax worse and worse through the <hi>power</hi> of Sin, untill it hath <hi>full dominion</hi> over them. Yea what Pretences soever they make to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves off from such Endeavours, it is either <hi>Ʋnbelief</hi> or the <hi>Love of Sin</hi> that is the sole <hi>proper Cause</hi> thereof. Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="3">(3) If the <hi>Backsliding</hi> (whereof men complain) from the wayes of <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> have not proceeded out of <hi>dislike</hi>
                  <pb n="557" facs="tcp:204232:290"/> unto Christ and the Gospel, if they have not by the Power and Deceit wherewith they are accompanyed, <hi>chosen any other Way</hi> of Duty or Sin in his stead; as there is all Necessity imaginable that they should, so there is all Encouragement necessary, to put them upon the diligent use of all Means of a <hi>Blessed Recovery.</hi> Suppose their <hi>Decayes</hi> have befallen them, or that they have fallen into them, through the <hi>Power of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> the Deceitfulness of Sin joyning with their own Sloth and Negligence, which is the highest Supposition that can be made in this Kind; yet if they shall say in their Hearts, that they <hi>will return to their former Husband, for then it was better with them than now;</hi> they had <hi>Peace</hi> and much <hi>Refreshment</hi> in their <hi>first Wayes</hi> of Faith and Obedience, which they will therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto; as the Lord Christ <hi>calls</hi> upon them so to doe, so he is ready in all the Promises of the Gospel to <hi>receive</hi> them upon their so doing. Onely let such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons remember, that the <hi>Command</hi> is urgent on them, as on <hi>Lot</hi> when he was to flee out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Angel said unto him, <hi>Escape for thy Life, look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plains, escape to the Mountains, lest thou be consumed.</hi>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:204232:291"/> There is no time of Deliberation, much less of Delay in this matter; it is for their <hi>Souls,</hi> and the present Moment wherein they are warned is the onely <hi>Season</hi> for their Escape; And if any shall yet linger as <hi>Lot</hi> did, the Lord lay hold upon them and bring them forth by the Power of his <hi>Grace,</hi> that they may be delivered. What are the Wayes whereby this may be done, what Duties such Persons are with Diligence to attend unto, what Means they are to use; are not things which at present fall under our Consideration. All that I design is to shew, that those who thus complain, are not cast under any Discouragement (by this <hi>Context</hi> and its <hi>Exposition)</hi> from an Endeavour of a <hi>Recovery,</hi> wherein they will find Acceptance with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> It may be alleadged, that as to the <hi>Issue</hi> of things it will be all one whether we <hi>fall</hi> from <hi>Gospel-Holiness,</hi> or can never <hi>attain</hi> unto it; And this, say some, is Our Condition: For whatever we have thought of our selves, or whatever others have thought of us upon our <hi>Profession,</hi> yet we now find by Experience that we have not <hi>attained</hi> the <hi>Holiness</hi> which the Gospel requires. For their <hi>Corruptions</hi> (they say, this or that it may be in particular,) are too
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:204232:291"/> strong for their <hi>Convictions;</hi> and after they thought themselves <hi>above</hi> them, they have again been <hi>prevailed on</hi> and overcome. They find the <hi>power</hi> of one or other Lust grown so <hi>habitual</hi> unto them, that they fall again and again under the <hi>power</hi> of it, untill (it may be) they have lost much of the <hi>sense</hi> of its Guilt, and more of their <hi>power</hi> to resist it. And it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged also, that this Condition is <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dangerous,</hi> and such as (if Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be not obtained from,) will probably end in <hi>total Apostasie.</hi> To state things aright in this Case, we may observe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are <hi>three Degrees</hi> in the Power and Prevalency of <hi>Sin,</hi> and it must be enquired under which of them they are supposed to be, concerning whom this Complaint is made. The first is that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>I see a Law in my Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers warring against the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin:</hi> Where this is onely, or the <hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating Power of Sin,</hi> there are two things to be considered. (1) That the <hi>Will</hi> in its Dispositions and Inclinations is constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>fixed</hi> against the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> so that in all its Prevalency it <hi>suffers</hi> Hardship, and is sensible of its Captivity.
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:204232:292"/> (2) That this <hi>Captivity</hi> unto the Law of <hi>Sin,</hi> doth not reach unto the <hi>outward Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration</hi> of Sin, but onely the <hi>Conflict</hi> that is in the Mind and Affections about it. And this is a Condition which no man in this World is <hi>absolutely</hi> freed from, but is in some measure or other exercised with it, even as the Apostle himself was, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on groaned for Deliverance, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Degree of the <hi>Prevalency of Sin</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16, 19. <hi>Know you not that to whom you yield your selves servants to obey, his servants you are unto whom you obey, whether of Sin unto Death, or of Obedience unto Righteousness?</hi> There is a <hi>State</hi> and <hi>prevalency</hi> of Sin, wherein men being wholly under its Dominion do give up themselves unto its Service willingly, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Checks from Light or Conscience they meet withall. And such as these, the <hi>willing Servants of Sin,</hi> that yield up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their Affections and Members of their Bodies unto the Obedience and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of it, we do not at present consider. Between these there is a Degree of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> beyond the first, yet falling short of the latter, expressed 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. Men are therein in some sence <hi>Servants of Corruption,</hi> in that they are <hi>overcome</hi> by it,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:204232:292"/> and brought into Bondage. They are not such as <hi>willingly</hi> without any <hi>Contest</hi> or <hi>Conflict</hi> give up themselves unto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Sin, but they are <hi>overcome</hi> by it, which manifests that they do in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <hi>strive</hi> against it. And on the other hand they go beyond them who complain they are <hi>led Captives</hi> to the Law of Sin; For they are said to <hi>become Servants to Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which the others are not in any sence. These therefore seem to be such, and such I do intend, who notwithstanding all their <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Convictions,</hi> with all the <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors</hi> that they use, are so far under the <hi>power</hi> of some prevalent <hi>habitual Lust,</hi> as to <hi>serve</hi> it in a frequent Reiteration of <hi>Actual Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If this be the <hi>Case</hi> complained of, it is acknowledged to be a Condition of <hi>no small hazard</hi> and Danger. And he who is not deeply <hi>sensible</hi> hereof, is like him that lyeth down in the midst of the Sea, or as he that lyeth on the Top of a Mast; as this state is at large described with respect unto them who <hi>are given to Wine; Prov.</hi> 23. 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. Wherefore, unless some <hi>Remedy</hi> be found out in this Case, it must be acknowledged that it will deprive men of, or keep them from any assured <hi>Interest</hi> in <hi>Gospel-Holiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="562" facs="tcp:204232:293"/>
               <p> I must not here divert to consider in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of the <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Sin;</hi> I have done it already in other <hi>Discourses,</hi> with the <hi>best Directions</hi> for that End which I am able to propose. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them I do referre the Persons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Guidance and Counsel where better is not at hand. Unto what hath been so treated already I shall onely adde, that those who would secure an <hi>Interest</hi> in <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Holiness,</hi> by a Deliverance from the <hi>power</hi> of Inveterate <hi>habitual Corruptions,</hi> may take the ensuing Directions.</p>
               <p>First, If they have <hi>in vain</hi> attempted their own <hi>Deliverance,</hi> let them not delay to acquaint some <hi>able Spiritual Guide</hi> with their State and Condition. This sometimes hath broken, defeated, and scattered at once the <hi>Forces of Sin</hi> in the Soul, where in its own Wisdom and Strength it was no way able to <hi>conflict</hi> with it. And it is the <hi>Ordinance of God</hi> to this purpose; <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Confess your Faults one to another,</hi> &amp;c. It was no small Effect of the Craft of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> so to abuse this Ordinance of God by turning it into a <hi>necessary Confession</hi> of all Sin unto <hi>a Priest,</hi> invested with Power of <hi>Absolution,</hi> which was attended with innumerable Evils, and proved an effectual
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:204232:293"/> Engine for the Ruine of the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, to keep them off from that Benefit which the due use of it was designed to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister unto Sinners. If therefore any have found that Sin <hi>hath</hi> been, and yet <hi>is too strong</hi> for them, and that <hi>that</hi> is come upon them which the Wise man mentions, <hi>Woe unto him that is alone;</hi> let them address themselves for Advice unto such as have <hi>the Tongue of the Learned,</hi> to speak a Word <hi>in season</hi> unto them that are <hi>weary</hi> and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to <hi>faint,</hi> and they will find Relief; God will <hi>discover</hi> that Evil of this kind, which Men will <hi>hide</hi> to their own Disadvantage. He will lay open those <hi>festered Wounds</hi> which men would cover untill <hi>Rottenness</hi> enter into their Bones.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Effect</hi> aimed at will never be Accomplished without <hi>Violence</hi> offered unto <hi>our selves</hi> as unto all Occasions of Sin, namely, as to the <hi>particular Corruption</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed prevalent. In this Case, when known Occasions of the Excitation or Actings of the Evil complained of do occurre, no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations or Inclinations or Civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyances are once to be admitted. <hi>Violence</hi> and suddain Executions of fore-taken Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves without any Parly or Debate, are to be pursued. This is the Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:204232:294"/> our Saviours Advice must take place, if we intend to escape; namely, of <hi>pulling out a Right Eye,</hi> and <hi>cutting off a Right Hand; Math.</hi> 5. 29, 30; which cannot be done without offering Violence unto our Affections and Inclinations. This is the Meaning of the Counsel given, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 14, 15. <hi>Enter not into the Path of the Wicked, and goe not in the Way of evil men; avoyd it, pass not by it, turn from it and pass away.</hi> The Multiplication of the Expressions wherein the Duty charged doth consist, do intimate that in the Obedience requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this particular, a Resolution acted with an <hi>holy Violence</hi> is required. And there are three things in this <hi>holy Violence</hi> with respect unto the <hi>Occasions</hi> of a <hi>preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) The <hi>Minds Rejection</hi> of their <hi>first Solicitations.</hi> When such <hi>Seasons</hi> do befall, or are befalling any Man, wherein his Lust or Sin hath wonted to act it self, they <hi>smile</hi> on one another, and are ready to shake hands in Folly. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 31. And sundry things will present themselves unto the <hi>Mind</hi> to render the Occasion <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> or at least not <hi>dangerous.</hi> But if all <hi>Insinuation</hi> of that kind be not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>rejected</hi> without Parly or Delay, the
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:204232:294"/> Soul probably will be again entangled and overcome.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) A <hi>stated Satisfaction</hi> concerning the Folly of <hi>Reserves</hi> although the <hi>Occasion</hi> should be complyed withall or embraced, so as that the Mind will hear no more of them under any Pretence whatever. Such <hi>Reserves</hi> will offer themselves, that although a Man proceed so far, or so far in the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of his present <hi>Inclinations,</hi> yet he will put <hi>a stop</hi> unto or <hi>avoyd</hi> what they may lead unto. When the Mind is fully possessed of the <hi>Deceitfulness</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will see its own Folly in listening after such false Promises or Reserves, and reject the first Thoughts of them with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>Local Mutation,</hi> or avoyding the <hi>Place</hi> it self, or <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>Company,</hi> with an holy Force put upon the Affections, where such Occasions are offered. This is that which is so expressed and pressed on us in the Place before mentioned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>These things belong unto that <hi>holy Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> which men are to use unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and must use if ever they intend to be freed from the Power of an <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> prevalent Corruption. And those
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:204232:295"/> who judge their Deliverance not to be worth this <hi>Watchfulness</hi> and Care, will live and dye under the <hi>power</hi> of Sin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Constancy in private Prayer</hi> against the <hi>power</hi> of such a Corruption. This is all the way a Man hath to deal with God about such an Evil. For such things are to be thought and spoken, such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to be insisted on, and such Pleas to be used, as are not meet to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to or with others. And for the most part it will be found, that constant, earnest, faithfull <hi>private Prayer,</hi> and any <hi>strong Corruption,</hi> will be like <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck.</hi> When <hi>Moses</hi> his Hands were down, <hi>Amaleck</hi> prevailed; but when they were lifted up, <hi>Israel</hi> had the upper hand. And if a Man engages into <hi>especcial Prayer,</hi> in opposition unto any Sin or Corruption, whatever he thinks of his own Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whatever Confidence he hath in his Purposes, as he begins to fail or faint in the Constancy or Fervency of that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so his Sin gets Strength in him, and will not fail to attempt him successefully on the next Occasion. Nor will the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most-Effect of any mans Wisdom, or Care, or Ability, work out his Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in this Case, without a Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:204232:295"/> Attendance unto, and Discharge of their <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sundry other things of an alike Nature unto these might be insisted on, but that I must not too far digress from my <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Design.</hi> This I thought meet to interpose for the Direction of such as may be kept off from a successefull En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour <hi>to perfect Holiness in the Fear of the Lord.</hi>

               <head type="sub">Directions to avoyd the Power of a prevailing Apostasie.</head>
               <p>UNto the <hi>Warnings</hi> given in the precedent <hi>Chapter</hi> some <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> may be added, perhaps not unusefull unto them who would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from the Occasions, Causes and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> thus far enquired into. For although (as hath been declared,) a <hi>watchfull Attendance unto all Gospel Duties, and a vigorous Exercise of all Gospel Graces in general</hi> are required unto our Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, yet there are some things which have an especial Respect unto the present State of the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the Evil insisted on, which ought in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner to be remembred. And that things of this Nature are by many <hi>despised,</hi> is no Argument why we should not be <hi>diligent</hi> in our Attendance unto them. For if they are such things as the Scripture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:204232:296"/> in the like Cases, the Contempt of them proceeds onely from that Pride and Security which are no small part of the <hi>Apostasie</hi> complained of.</p>
               <p>Our First Direction of this kind is, that we should <hi>all labour for a true real sence of the Concernment of the Glory of God in this matter,</hi> and what is <hi>our Duty</hi> with respect thereunto. Where this is not, Men are under the <hi>power</hi> of that Security which is the <hi>broad Way</hi> and <hi>wide Gate</hi> leading into Apostasie. Yea where this is not the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> thing wherewith we are affected in any Evil that falls out in the World, our Hearts are not upright in what we profess.</p>
               <p>When God threatned to disinherit the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and destroy the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as one Man in the Wilderness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their provoking Rebellion; that wherewith <hi>Moses</hi> in all the Circumstances of his <hi>Relation</hi> unto them and <hi>Interest</hi> in them was affected withall, was, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Name</hi> of God therein; <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. And it was so with <hi>Joshua</hi> in the Sin and Punishment of the same People. <hi>What wilt thou doe</hi> (saith he) <hi>unto thy great Name; Josh.</hi> 7. 9. Words which have been made a
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:204232:297"/> publick Derision in the dayes wherein we live.</p>
               <p>We cannot but have Thoughts about these things, for they are the common Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of many Mens Discourse. But if our Thoughts about them are confined unto a <hi>narrow Compass,</hi> and so that it be well with us and some few others in whom we are peculiarly concerned, the Evil that is come on the World in other places, is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set by; if we are sensible of no Interest of the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> of the <hi>Honour of Christ</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> therein, or are Regardless of them, we are scarce likely to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from that fatal Issue whereunto all these things are in an open Tendency.</p>
               <p>Is it nothing unto us that <hi>so many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in the World where the <hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>the Gospel,</hi> and an avowed Subjection of Soul and Conscience unto Jesus Christ did flourish for some Ages, are now utterly over-run with <hi>Mahumetisme, Paganisme,</hi> and <hi>Atheisme?</hi> Do we suppose these things are fallen out by <hi>Chance,</hi> or come to pass by a <hi>fatal Revolution</hi> of Affairs, such as all things in this World are obnoxious unto? Did ever any Nation or People under Heaven <hi>lose the Gospel</hi> as unto its <hi>Profession,</hi> who did not first reject it as unto its <hi>Power,</hi>
                  <pb n="571" facs="tcp:204232:297"/>
                  <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Obedience?</hi> And is not the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> is not the <hi>Honour of Christ</hi> peculiarly concerned herein?</p>
               <p>Is it nothing unto us, that innumerable Souls who yet continue to make an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profession</hi> of the Name of Christ, have so degenerated from the <hi>Mystery, Holiness</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> of the Gospel, as to provoke the Holy God to give them up for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Generations unto the most wofull <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> that ever any of the Children of men were cast under from the Foundation of the World, without the least Hopes or Appearance of Relief? And is it not to be bewailed, that such is the <hi>power</hi> of that <hi>Apostasie</hi> which brought all this Evil upon them, as that they have not to this day <hi>accepted of the Punishment of their Sins,</hi> nor been bettered by all that they have undergone? And doth not that Holy Name whereby we are called suffer in these things? Is it not on their Account Evil spoken of? For do not the <hi>Miseries,</hi> the long continued wofull <hi>Calamities</hi> and Oppressions of innumerable Multitudes, of great Nations, <hi>outwardly Professing the Christian Religion,</hi> become a snare to the World, and a Temptation against the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi>
                  <pb n="572" facs="tcp:204232:298"/> The <hi>Jews</hi> themselves are not left unto more <hi>Distresses,</hi> nor more destitute of any <hi>pledges</hi> of <hi>divine Protection,</hi> nor are more <hi>unreformed</hi> under their Miseries, than many who are called <hi>Christians,</hi> upon the Account of their <hi>Apostasie</hi> from the <hi>Gospel.</hi> It is true, <hi>great Distresses,</hi> and <hi>sore Persecutions</hi> may befall the Church in its <hi>best State</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi> But then doth God so dispose of all things, as that their Trials shall evidently tend both unto his <hi>own Glory</hi> and their <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Advantage</hi> who are exercised with them. And in the Issue the <hi>Gospel</hi> it self shall never be a Loser by the <hi>suffering</hi> of its <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Professors.</hi> But in those horrible <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which have befallen many parts of the <hi>Apostatized Christian World,</hi> nothing offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self unto our Minds but what is matter of <hi>Lamentation</hi> and <hi>Temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it nothing to us that the greatest Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those who are <hi>called Christians</hi> and enjoy Prosperity in the World, do live in <hi>open Idolatry,</hi> to the unspeakable Scandal of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and eminent Danger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>themselves</hi> of <hi>Eternal Ruine?</hi> Nothing that so many do openly renounce the <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meek Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to <hi>persecute, ruine</hi> and <hi>destroy</hi> other Christians perhaps <hi>better</hi> than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:204232:298"/> because they cannot captivate their <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> in Obedience unto their <hi>Impositions?</hi> Nothing to see and hear of all those <hi>dreadfull Effects</hi> of this <hi>Apostasie</hi> in all manner of <hi>Outragious Sins</hi> that the World is filled withall?</p>
               <p>Certainly if we are not greatly <hi>affected</hi> with these things, if our Souls <hi>mourn</hi> not <hi>in secret</hi> about them, if we are not solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about the <hi>small Remainders</hi> of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> in the World, we are in no small <hi>danger</hi> our selves of being (one time or other) carryed away with the Deluge.</p>
               <p>If we are sensible of the Concernment of the <hi>Glory of God</hi> in these things, it may not be amiss to consider <hi>What is our Duty</hi> with respect thereunto.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>first</hi> thing required of us, is, that <hi>we mourn in secret</hi> for that <hi>sad Issue</hi> which the Profession of <hi>Christianity</hi> is come unto in the World. God puts an <hi>especial Mark</hi> on them who <hi>mourn for the Prevalency of Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Apostasie of the Church</hi> in any Season. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. Neither will he have regard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any others when he comes to execute Judgements on <hi>ungodly Apostates.</hi> Men may <hi>suffer</hi> with them, with whom they will not <hi>sin.</hi> For where we are unconcerned for the
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:204232:299"/>
                  <hi>Sins</hi> of men, we shall not be so in their <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi> It is therefore those alone who out of a sense of the <hi>dishonour</hi> of God, and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion</hi> towards the Souls of perishing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, do <hi>sigh</hi> and <hi>cry</hi> over <hi>these Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that shall be either <hi>preserved</hi> from those <hi>publick Calamities</hi> wherein they may issue, or be comfortably <hi>supported</hi> under them. And there is nothing of a more <hi>Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous presage</hi> that things are yet <hi>waxing worse,</hi> than that general <hi>Regardlesness</hi> about them that is among the Best of us. Whose Eyes <hi>run down with Waters</hi> because <hi>Men keep not the Law?</hi> Who doth sufficiently bewail the Decayes of <hi>Faith, Truth</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> that are in the Earth? Most men (like <hi>Gallio)</hi> either <hi>care for none of these things,</hi> or at best, <hi>design</hi> to <hi>save their own Houses</hi> in the <hi>general Conflagration.</hi> Many measure all things by their <hi>own Advantage,</hi> and can see nothing amiss in the Profession of <hi>Religion,</hi> but onely in the <hi>Complaints</hi> that any things are so. And although the <hi>Degeneracy</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> in the present Professors of it be grown a <hi>common Theam</hi> in the Mouths of most, yet very few are <hi>affected</hi> with it in a due Manner in their Hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> It is in <hi>this state of things</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us to <hi>Pray continually,</hi> pleading
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:204232:299"/> those Promises which are Recorded in the Word of God for the Restauration of the <hi>pristine Glory, Power</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> This was the Way and Means whereby the Church was recovered of Old; and the same Duty is still enjoyned unto us, <hi>Isa.</hi> 62. 6, 7. And hereunto are all our present Hopes reduced. There is nothing too hard for God. If He will <hi>work</hi> herein none shall <hi>lett him.</hi> Things are not gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>his Cure.</hi> He can send <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> from <hi>above,</hi> and cause them to <hi>prevail</hi> on the Earth. Were all things left absolutely unto the <hi>Wills</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> in that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved state</hi> whereunto they are arrived in the World, nothing but an <hi>Encrease</hi> of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreading <hi>Abominations</hi> might be expected. <hi>Soveraign and Effectual Grace</hi> can yet give Relief, and nothing else can so doe. <hi>Truely in vain is Salvation hoped for from the Hills and the multitude of Mountains, truely in the Lord our God is the Salvation of Israel.</hi> But for all these things will God be sought unto. And <hi>Constancy</hi> in this Duty for others, out of a deep <hi>sence</hi> of the Concernment of the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is the most <hi>Effectual Means</hi> of our own Deliverance and Preservation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly; Constancy in our Testimony</hi> against
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:204232:300"/> the <hi>prevalency</hi> of this <hi>Apostasie,</hi> is required of us. And hereof there are two parts. (1) An <hi>open avowed Profession</hi> of, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi> for the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</hi> The <hi>publick Contempt</hi> and <hi>scorn</hi> that is by a <hi>prevalent Vogue</hi> cast on some <hi>important Evangelical Truths,</hi> is ready to discourage many from the <hi>owning</hi> and <hi>profession</hi> of them. Men for the most part have so many things to take into Consideration before they will undertake the <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> that they can find no <hi>Season</hi> for it, whilest <hi>noysome Errors</hi> are vented every day with <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>diligence.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Now (if ever) a Time for all those in whose <hi>Hearts are the Wayes of God,</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend earnestly for the Faith once delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints.</hi> And if either Sloth or Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, or carnal Fears, or Earthly Ambitious Designs, do <hi>betray</hi> any into a <hi>Neglect</hi> of their <hi>Duty</hi> in this matter, it will at one time or other give them <hi>disquietment</hi> and <hi>trouble.</hi> But (2) <hi>Exemplary Holiness, Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Fruitfulness in good Works,</hi> belong unto this <hi>Testimony</hi> against the <hi>prevalent Apostasie</hi> which is required of us. As this is our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Duty</hi> at all times, so the Progress of the <hi>fatal evil</hi> complained of, renders the <hi>doubling</hi> of our <hi>diligence</hi> herein at present necessary, and puts a Lustre on it.</p>
               <pb n="577" facs="tcp:204232:300"/>
               <p> Secondly; Those who would be <hi>preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in such a Season, must <hi>keep a due and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Watch over their own Hearts,</hi> with respect unto their <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Danger.</hi> For although <hi>Temptations</hi> do abound, and those attended with all sorts of Circumstances encreasing their <hi>Efficacy,</hi> and the Outward Means and Causes of this Evil are multiplyed, yet the <hi>Beginnings</hi> of all mens spiritual Declensions are in their own <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Spirits.</hi> For the <hi>different Effects</hi> that these things have upon the <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> of Men, is principally from themselves. As they are carefull, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and watchfull over themselves in a way of <hi>Duty</hi> on the one hand, or slothfull, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, negligent on the other, so are they <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served</hi> or <hi>prevailed</hi> against. The Advice therefore I intend, is that given by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost in this Case, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Keep thy Heart with all diligence, for out of it are the Issues of Life;</hi> or as it is Emphatically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the Original, <hi>Above all Keeping, keep thy Heart.</hi> The greatest Exercise of men in the World, is about <hi>keeping what they have,</hi> what they esteem <hi>their own,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Desire of <hi>adding</hi> unto it, is of the same Nature. What belongeth hereunto, What <hi>Care,</hi> what <hi>Watchfulness,</hi> what <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> what Exercise of their <hi>utmost Wisdom</hi>
                  <pb n="578" facs="tcp:204232:301"/> and <hi>Industry,</hi> all men know; unless it be such as by the <hi>power</hi> of their <hi>Lusts</hi> are given up unto <hi>Prodigality</hi> and Profuseness. But the Care and Diligence in <hi>keeping of our Hearts,</hi> (the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> being Judge) ought to exceed whatever of that kind is employed about other things. And it is too evident, that there is much want of this <hi>wisdom</hi> amongst us in the <hi>World.</hi> Of all things, the <hi>least Diligence</hi> is used by many in <hi>keeping of their Hearts.</hi> So they can <hi>safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard</hi> their other <hi>Concerns,</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> may be left to take its own Course. Yea the <hi>Heart</hi> is never so much <hi>neglected</hi> usually, nor more <hi>lost</hi> than in the use it is put unto in <hi>keeping other things;</hi> for whilest it is employed to <hi>keep</hi> our Lives, to keep the World, and the things of it, it <hi>is lost</hi> it self in Worldliness, Covetousness, carnal Wisdom, Negligence of holy Duties, and Barrenness in the Fruits of Righteousness. That this is no good Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that nothing is got hereby, yea that all will be <hi>lost</hi> by it at last, <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>World</hi> and every thing wherein we are concerned, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> plainly intimates in this <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> wherein we are commanded above all things to <hi>keep our Hearts.</hi> And we are not onely laid under this <hi>command,</hi> but a <hi>cogent Reason</hi> is added to enforce our Obedience;
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:204232:301"/>
                  <hi>For out of it are the Issues of Life.</hi> Hereon do all <hi>Events</hi> depend; The <hi>Heart</hi> being <hi>kept,</hi> the whole Course of <hi>our Life</hi> here will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the <hi>Mind</hi> of God, and the End of it wlll be the Enjoyment of Him hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This being neglected, <hi>Life</hi> will be <hi>lost,</hi> both here as unto <hi>Obedience,</hi> and hereafter as unto <hi>Glory.</hi> This therefore is that which in the first place is to be applyed unto the present Case. Would any not be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>prevalency</hi> of any of the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Apostasie</hi> mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let them look well unto their <hi>own Hearts,</hi> seeing that from thence are <hi>the Issues of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>Heart</hi> the Scripture understandeth all the <hi>Faculties</hi> of our <hi>Souls</hi> as they are an intire <hi>rational Principle</hi> of all <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Operations;</hi> and so do we also. The <hi>preservation</hi> of them in their <hi>due Order,</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things according unto their <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Powers</hi> and the <hi>Duty</hi> of the <hi>whole Soul</hi> with respect unto <hi>God,</hi> is that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by this <hi>keeping of the Heart;</hi> And hereunto with reference unto the <hi>present duty</hi> sundry things do belong in an especial manner: As,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) That the <hi>Heart</hi> be kept <hi>awake and attentive unto its own Deceitfulness.</hi> The
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:204232:302"/> Wise man tells us, that <hi>he that trusteth in his own Heart is a Fool; Prov.</hi> 28. 26. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all <hi>Security</hi> (which is an assured Entrance into all Evil) lyes in Mens leaving their Hearts unto themselves and <hi>trusting</hi> in them. He is no <hi>wise man</hi> (the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judge) who after so many Instructions and Warnings given us in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> of the <hi>Deceitfulness of our Hearts,</hi> or the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness</hi> of that <hi>Sin</hi> which is bound up in them, (which is all one,) will carelessely trust them with their <hi>Eternal Concernments.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> did so once upon a strong Confidence that his <hi>Heart</hi> would not fail him; but we know what was the Issue of it. It is apt to be so with most men in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They think and do really judge, that if all men should <hi>fall off</hi> and <hi>forsake</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, either <hi>wholly</hi> or as unto the <hi>degrees</hi> in <hi>Obedience</hi> which they have attained, yet <hi>they</hi> would not so doe. But all things are filled with <hi>visible Examples</hi> of their Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments. There are no <hi>Apostates</hi> but once thought they would not be so. For we speak onely of them who had <hi>Light</hi> into and <hi>Conviction</hi> of their <hi>Duty,</hi> and who had therefore necessarily <hi>Resolutions</hi> to continue therein. Wherefore, a constant watchfull <hi>Jealousie</hi> over our own Hearts as to their
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:204232:302"/>
                  <hi>Deceitfulness,</hi> their Readiness to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on, and secret Pretences to countenance themselves in complyance with <hi>Temptations,</hi> is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all other Duties necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto our Preservation.</p>
               <p>Even this also is by some despised. They know of <hi>no deceitfulness in their own Hearts,</hi> nor think there is any such thing in the Hearts of others. They cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there is mutual <hi>Deceit</hi> enough amongst Mankind in the World; but that there should be <hi>Deceit and Treachery in Mens Hearts</hi> with respect unto themselves, their own Actions, Duties and Wayes; with respect unto God and their own Eternal Condition, <hi>that</hi> they cannot apprehend. For, what or whom should a Man trust un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if he may not safely repose his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in <hi>his own Heart,</hi> that it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes true unto its <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest? Happy Men, were such Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as these to be the Rule of their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Duty</hi> or <hi>future Judgement.</hi> But is it not possible there may be in the Hearts of men a blind <hi>Self-love,</hi> so far predominant as practically to impose false Apprehensions and Notions of things upon the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> with respect unto <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Duty?</hi> Is there no <hi>Disorder</hi> in the Faculties of our
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:204232:303"/> Souls, nor <hi>Confusion</hi> in their Operations thereon? Are there <hi>no Remainders</hi> of Sin inseparable from them in this Life, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with all manner of spiritual Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness? No <hi>corrupt Reasonings</hi> for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crastination of the most important Duties? No <hi>Inclinations</hi> unto undue Prefidences and Presumptions? No <hi>Vanity</hi> or <hi>Ʋncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> in the Mind? Or can these things (with the like innumerable) be supposed without any Deceit in them or accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of them? What one said of Old to the <hi>Druides,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Solis nôsse Deos &amp; Coeli Numina vobis</l>
                     <l>Aut Solis nescire datum.—</l>

If this be neglected, we shall labour in vain, whatever else we doe. Blessed is he who thus <hi>feareth alwayes.</hi> This will make

A bold, hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, careless Frame of Spirit, venturing on all <hi>Companyes</hi> and <hi>Temptations,</hi> complying with <hi>Vanities</hi> and prophane <hi>Communication,</hi> offering it self with a <hi>fearless Confidence</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wayes of <hi>Seduction,</hi> through the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sleights of Men that <hi>lye in wait to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;</hi> is that which hath ruined innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Professors. Self-distrust, Humility, Fear of offending, with the like <hi>Soul-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Graces,</hi> will be kept up unto Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise onely where men are <hi>awake</hi> unto the Consideration of the <hi>Deceitfulness</hi> of their own Hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) We must keep our <hi>Heart awake and attentive unto its Help and Relief.</hi> And this lyes onely in <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> the Captain of our Salvation. After all <hi>Peters</hi> Confidence, it was the <hi>Interposition</hi> of Christ alone that preserved him from utter Ruine; <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not▪</hi> And if any can once prevail so far as to deterre men from looking for all spiritual Help and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from Christ, for daily <hi>supplyes</hi> of Grace and Strength from him alone; from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:204232:304"/> Application unto him, for directing, assisting, preserving, establishing Grace, (which they variously attempt,) there is no need to fear, but they will easily follow them into whatever else, either they or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, or the World shall have a mind to draw them. But in all our <hi>Discourses</hi> we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on other Principles. We look on Jesus <hi>Christ</hi> as the <hi>Spring and Fountain</hi> of all <hi>Grace,</hi> as He who alone is able to preserve us in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and doth communicate supplyes of <hi>effectual Grace</hi> unto Believers for that purpose. Unto him therefore are we to make our Applications continually by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> for our Preservation, as we are directed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15, 16. It is He alone who can <hi>keep us from the Hour of Temptation which is come upon all the World, to trye them that dwell on the Earth; Rev.</hi> 3. 10. Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore would be kept from the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of the Temptations unto Apostasie, which every way encompass us, and threaten to bear down all before them, let them keep their <hi>Hearts</hi> continually attentive unto their onely Help and Relief. Those who have not taken in a <hi>sence</hi> of their <hi>danger,</hi> will see little Reason to concern themselves in these <hi>Directions.</hi> But as for such as are affected with the visible Ruine of Multitudes, and
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:204232:304"/> their own apparent Hazard, from prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Causes</hi> and innumerable <hi>Occasions</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whose Eyes are in any measure opened to see the <hi>general Inclination</hi> that is in the World unto a <hi>Relinquishment</hi> of all the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Concerns</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> by what various <hi>wayes</hi> that Inclination is furthered, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pursued, will not think it unneed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be minded of an Help and Refuge whereunto they may betake themselves and be preserved.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Let the <hi>Heart</hi> be kept <hi>attentive</hi> unto its <hi>own Frames,</hi> its Progress or Decayes in <hi>Holiness.</hi> How secret, and even oft-times <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible</hi> the Beginnings of spiritual <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clensions</hi> are in many, with the Reasons and Causes thereof, hath been declared in our <hi>Exposition</hi> of <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. whither the Reader is referred. I shall here onely offer, that he who in such a Season as that which is passing over us, doth not often <hi>call himself unto an account</hi> how things stand with him as to the <hi>inner Man;</hi> what is the State of his <hi>spiritual Life,</hi> whether his <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> do thrive or decay, whether <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>World</hi> get ground in his Affections, will be exposed unto more <hi>dangers</hi> than it may be he is readily able to deliver himself from. These things are all of them <hi>usefull,</hi>
                  <pb n="586" facs="tcp:204232:305"/> yea <hi>needfull</hi> unto the Course of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all times. That which is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is, their <hi>exercise</hi> and <hi>discharge</hi> with respect unto the Evil and Danger under Consideration. When we have done the <hi>utmost</hi> of our Duty, we shall have cause to rejoyce in the <hi>Grace of God</hi> if we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and delivered. But if we be found <hi>slothfull, negligent</hi> and <hi>secure,</hi> what Hopes can we have that we shall <hi>withstand</hi> the Evil that doth on every side beset us? There is not any Way of <hi>Fraud</hi> or <hi>Force</hi> wherein we either <hi>are</hi> not or <hi>may</hi> not be assaulted. The secret Wayes whereby this <hi>Apostasie</hi> puts forth its Efficacy, are so various as not to be enumerated. The Current, furthered by the Winds of all sorts of Temptations, lyes strongly against us. New Accessions are made unto it every day. New Pretences against the <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> are sought out and made use of. By some they are secretly undermined, by others openly despised; and the <hi>hand of Sathan</hi> is in all these things. If we should now <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> a watchfull <hi>care</hi> over our own Hearts, and a diligent Attendance unto all Means of their Preservation in <hi>soundness</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>holiness</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> what Assurance can we have that we shall finally escape?</p>
               <pb n="587" facs="tcp:204232:305"/>
               <p> Having premised these <hi>Directions</hi> in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> those which ensue must have a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> respect unto some of the especial <hi>wayes</hi> and <hi>means</hi> whereby this Declension hath been carried on and promoted, peculiarly such as the <hi>present Age and Season</hi> are most obnoxious unto. And because this <hi>Discourse</hi> is drawn forth to a length beyond my first Design, I shall name a few things onely to intimate of what sort those <hi>Directions</hi> are which might be more largely insisted on. And two only shall be named; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Take heed of Resting in or Trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the outward Priviledges of the Church,</hi> and a <hi>participation</hi> of the <hi>Dispensation</hi> of the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> therein. It is known what various Apprehensions as to the especial Wayes of <hi>outward solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> and the <hi>State of the Church,</hi> there are among all sorts of Men. But whereas all men do approve of and adhere unto <hi>one Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state</hi> or other, one way of Worship or other, I intend no one more than another in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but would speak unto all with respect unto <hi>that Way</hi> which themselves do approve and practise. And it was before declared, how greatly the World was deluded by a <hi>Pretence</hi> of them. And we may not think to
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:204232:306"/> excuse the Necessity of <hi>Watchfulness</hi> in this matter, because all the good things of the Church, and all the Ordinances of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel were then <hi>abused, corrupted</hi> and <hi>defiled,</hi> whereas we now all of us (in our own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions) enjoy their Administration in <hi>purity,</hi> according unto the Institution of <hi>Christ.</hi> For they are all of them no less liable to be abused in this kind, when duely Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, than when most corrupted. Yea in some Cases they are more apt so to be, seeing there is a greater appearance of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> why we should place our <hi>confidence</hi> in them.</p>
               <p>It is indeed an especial Mercy for any to be entrusted with the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the Church, and <hi>Institutions</hi> of the Gospel. Yea it is the greatest outward Dignity and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence that any can be advanced unto in this World, however by the most it be lightly set by. <hi>Theodosius,</hi> one of the greatest Emperours that ever were in the World, affirmed that he esteemed his being <hi>a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church</hi> a greater Dignity than his <hi>Imperial Crown.</hi> And although the Ruine of the <hi>Jews</hi> arose principally from their carnal Confidence in their <hi>spiritual</hi> or <hi>Church Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi> yet the Apostle doth acknowledge that they had great Preheminence and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:204232:306"/> and might have had great Profit thereby, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 4. And theirs must be granted more Excellent in every kind, who enjoy that Administration of Holy Things, in comparison whereof that committed unto the <hi>Jews</hi> had neither <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> nor <hi>Glory;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. By whomsoever therefore these things are <hi>despised</hi> or <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,</hi> under whatever Pretences they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance themselves, they are utter <hi>strangers</hi> unto Gospel Holiness. For what Holiness can there be where men live in an <hi>open diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto the Commands of Christ,</hi> and a Neglect of the <hi>use</hi> of those Means which he hath appointed to <hi>beget</hi> and <hi>preserve</hi> it in our Souls? Nothing therefore must be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to take off from the <hi>Excellency, Dignity</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> of the <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of the Church, when we would call off men from placing that Confidence in them which may tend unto their Disadvantage. And if Persons can find no <hi>Medium</hi> between <hi>rejecting</hi> all the Ordinances of the Gospel, and <hi>trusting</hi> unto the outward Performance or Celebration of them, they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their own Darkness, Pride and Unbelief to ascribe the Ruine of their Souls unto.</p>
               <p>Again; There is not any thing in the
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:204232:307"/> whole Course of our Obedience wherein the continual Exercise of <hi>Faith and spiritual Wisdom</hi> with <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Watchfulness</hi> is more indispensibly required than it is unto the due Use and Improvement of Gospel Priviledges and Ordinances; for there is no other part of our Duty, whereon our <hi>giving Glory to God,</hi> and the <hi>Eternal Concern</hi> of our own Souls do more eminently depend. And He is a spiritually thriving Christian who know how duely to Improve <hi>Gospel Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> of Worship, and doth so according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For they are the onely ordinary Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means whereby the Lord Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates of his Grace unto us, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we immediately return Love, Praise, Thanks, and Obedience unto him; in which spiritual Entercourse the Actings of our spiritual Life principally do consist, and whereon by Consequence its <hi>Growth</hi> doth depend. It is therefore certain, that our Growth or Decay in <hi>Holiness,</hi> our Stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness in or <hi>Apostasie</hi> from Profession, are greatly influenced by the <hi>use</hi> or <hi>abuse</hi> of these Priviledges.</p>
               <p>That therefore which in complyance with my present Design I intend, is onely a <hi>Warning</hi> that we doe not <hi>rest in these Things,</hi> the Name, Title, Priviledge, and
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:204232:307"/> outward Observance of them; seeing so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have thereby been deluded into Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Apostasie. Some there are, (and of them not a few) all whose Religion consists in <hi>going to Church,</hi> and abiding there during the celebration of that sort of <hi>Worship</hi> which they approve of. Herewith they satisfie their Consciences as unto all that they have to doe with God, especially if they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto a participation of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the appointed Seasons. And many others (it is to be feared) content themselves with a bare <hi>hearing of the Word,</hi> and do treat their Consciences into a <hi>quietness</hi> and <hi>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> thereby. It were otherwise impossible that among so great Multitudes as crowd after the <hi>preaching</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> so few should be wrought over unto sincere and universal Obedience. But I intend those in particular who make a <hi>Profession</hi> of giving themselves up unto <hi>Gospel Obedience,</hi> and are thereon made Partakers of all <hi>Gospel Priviledges</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule. Let them take heed that they do not too much <hi>rest</hi> in, nor too much <hi>trust</hi> unto these <hi>outward things;</hi> For so they may doe sundry wayes unto their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First;</hi> Men may herein deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>by Spiritual Gifts,</hi> which may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:204232:308"/> in the <hi>first</hi> place among the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church. Some rest in the Gifts of <hi>others,</hi> and the Satisfaction they receive thereby. For by the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> of them mens <hi>Affections</hi> may be greatly moved, as also <hi>temporary Faith</hi> and <hi>evanid Joy</hi> be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excited. These things, it is to be feared, some <hi>live</hi> upon, without further care after a <hi>spring of living Water</hi> in themselves. Others may rest in their own Gifts, their Light, Knowledge, Ability to <hi>pray</hi> or <hi>speak</hi> of the things of God. But it is the Design of the Apostle, in the Context before insisted on to declare, that the most eminent <hi>spiritual Gifts</hi> with all their Effects, either in the <hi>Souls</hi> or <hi>Lives</hi> of them who are made Partakers of them, or in the <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>Edification,</hi> will not secure any Persons from <hi>total Apostasie;</hi> so also some shall be utterly rejected at the last Day, who were able to plead their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying and casting out Devils</hi> in the Name of Christ, and that in His Name they had <hi>done many wondrous Works, Math.</hi> 7. 22, 23. And therefore when his Disciples (who were <hi>true,</hi> but as yet <hi>weak</hi> Believers,) were <hi>greatly affected</hi> (and it may be <hi>lifted up)</hi> with the success they had in <hi>casting out of Devils</hi> in his Name, he recalls them from any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence therein, as unto their <hi>Eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,</hi>
                  <pb n="593" facs="tcp:204232:308"/> unto a <hi>trust</hi> in Gods <hi>free Electing Grace,</hi> with the Fruits thereof; <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 20. And the Reason hereof is, because these <hi>Gifts</hi> have no inseparable Relation unto any of the especial and peculiar <hi>Causes</hi> of Salvation. That which seemeth to be of any difficulty, is, that they are an <hi>especial Fruit</hi> of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Christ,</hi> purchased by his <hi>Death,</hi> given into his Power upon his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and first communicated on his <hi>Ascension.</hi> But all that followeth from hence is, that they are <hi>good and holy in themselves,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed unto <hi>good and holy Ends</hi> or <hi>Ʋses,</hi> namely, the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the Gospel, and <hi>Edification</hi> of the Church. But it doth not thence follow that they are <hi>saving</hi> unto them that do receive them, unless they are accompanyed with <hi>especial Grace</hi> towards them, and <hi>holy Obedience</hi> in them, from both which they are separable. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore greatly incumbent on all those who have received of these <hi>spiritual Gifts,</hi> to take care they be enlivened and acted by <hi>especial Grace.</hi> For if they are not carefull they will give them a Pretence and Apprehension of what they <hi>have not,</hi> and set a greater Lustre upon what <hi>they have,</hi> than it doth deserve. For in their Actings, because the Objects of them are <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly things,</hi> the
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:204232:309"/> same with that of <hi>especial Grace,</hi> men are apt to suppose that Grace is exercised when it may be far from them; And as to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession that men make, these <hi>Gifts</hi> will set it off with that Beauty as shall render it very acceptable unto others, and very well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing unto themselves. Both these tend evidently unto the Ruine of the Souls of Men, if not <hi>wisely</hi> managed and improved. Wherefore, by the way, to help us unto a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight Judgement in this matter, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve one certain difference between the Operations of <hi>spiritual Gifts</hi> which are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarily so on the one hand, and <hi>saving Grace</hi> on the other. Gifts have their <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Works</hi> which they are confined unto, according as their <hi>especial Nature</hi> is. <hi>In</hi> them they act vigorously, <hi>out</hi> of them they influence not the Soul at all. But the work of <hi>saving Grace</hi> is <hi>universal,</hi> equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting all Times, Occasions, Seasons and Duties. And although it may be acted more eminently at one Time than another, in one Instance of Duty than another, yet it enliveneth and disposeth the Heart alike unto all Obedience. But of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that is between <hi>spiritual Gifts</hi> and <hi>saving Grace,</hi> as also concerning their whole Nature and Use, I shall (God
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:204232:309"/> assisting) treat at large in another <hi>Discourse.</hi> At present I intend onely this Caution, that men Countenance not themselves by them, nor Resolve a <hi>Peace</hi> (or rather <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)</hi> into their <hi>Exercise,</hi> under real <hi>spiritual Decayes</hi> of Grace and Obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Too high an Estimation of any <hi>peculiar Way</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> is apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the <hi>Minds</hi> of some unto an <hi>hurtfull Confidence</hi> in these things. Having an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension that they alone have attained unto the <hi>Right Way</hi> of <hi>Gospel-Worship,</hi> and the Administration of its <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and that perhaps on such Accounts, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are eminently <hi>deceived,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin first greatly to <hi>value themselves,</hi> and then to <hi>despise</hi> all <hi>others,</hi> and (if they can) to <hi>persecute</hi> them. This insensibly works them unto a <hi>trust</hi> in that which they esteem so Excellent, and that unto an open Neglect of things of a greater weight and Moment. Thus is it not unusual to see Persons who are under the <hi>power</hi> of some singular Opinion and Practice in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to make <hi>one thing</hi> almost their whole Business; the Measure of other things and Persons, the Rule of Communion, and of all sincere Love; to value and esteem themselves and others according
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:204232:310"/> unto their Embracing or not Embracing of that Opinion. There is here something of that which God complains of in the Prophet; <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 5. And it were to be wished, that such Principles and Practices were not visibly accompanyed with a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay</hi> of Love, Humility, Meekness, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diffidence, Condescension and Zeal in other things; seeing where it is so, let mens <hi>outward Profession</hi> be what it will, the Plague of <hi>Apostasie</hi> is begun. Wherefore, although we ought greatly to prize, and to endeavour after the true <hi>Order</hi> of the Church of Christ, the <hi>Purity</hi> of Worship and Regular <hi>Administration</hi> of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet let us take heed that we <hi>prize not our selves</hi> too much on what we have attained; For if we do so, we shall be very apt to countenance our selves in other Neglects thereby, which will certainly bring us into a spiritual <hi>Sickness</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clension.</hi> And one way or other there is an undue <hi>Confidence</hi> placed in these <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Priviledges,</hi> when either any or all of the things ensuing are found among us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Neglect of private Duties.</hi> This ruinous Event never falls out among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, but it proceeds either from an
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:204232:310"/>
                  <hi>over-fulness</hi> of the World and its Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the <hi>Prevalency</hi> of some predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Lust, or a sinfull <hi>resting</hi> in or <hi>trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> unto the Duties of publick Worship; When all these concurre, (unless God Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually awaken the Soul,) it is in a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Condition.</hi> In particular, when men are satisfied, as unto <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> with that which is <hi>publick</hi> or in Communion with others, so as to countenance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a Neglect of the Duties of their <hi>private Retirements,</hi> they are in an high Road unto Apostasie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Indulgence of any private Lust,</hi> unto the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of the <hi>Flesh.</hi> This great Defect in the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> is frequently countenanced by Strictness in the <hi>form</hi> thereof. And a great Effect it is of the <hi>Deceitfulness of Sin,</hi> when it can delude the Minds of men, to <hi>justifie</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in any one <hi>Sin,</hi> with the Names, Titles, Reputation, and Priviledge of the <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> whereof they are made Partakers; And the secret Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of this Deceit is not easie to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is so also when <hi>a loose and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Frame</hi> in our <hi>Walking</hi> is indulged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to on the same Account. It is hard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:204232:311"/> to know Directly whence this is come to pass, that so many Professors of the <hi>Gospel</hi> should give up themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a negligent and careless <hi>Walk;</hi> but that it is so come to pass, is certain. There is no Truth more acknowledged than that <hi>a strict and close Walk with God,</hi> and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance thereunto on all Occasions with Diligence and Circumspection, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual conscientious Fear of <hi>Sin,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly required unto acceptable <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience</hi> or <hi>Holiness.</hi> Yet so it is, that many Professors walk with that Looseness and Carelesness, that venturous Boldness with respect unto the Occasions of Sinning, that Liberty or rather Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness of Conversation, as are utterly inconsistent therewithall. As there are many Causes hereof, so I fear this may be one among them, that they too much satisfie themselves with their Interest in the <hi>Church</hi> and its <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and with their Observance of <hi>publick Worship</hi> and the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> thereof, according to their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Stations and Capacities.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, the summe of this <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is, That if we would be preserved from the <hi>Prevalency</hi> of the present <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie,</hi> we must have a strict Regard unto
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:204232:311"/> our <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> with respect unto the Priviledges of the Church and Ordinances of <hi>Gospel-Worship.</hi> If we <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> or <hi>despise</hi> them, we cast off the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Christ, and have no ground to look for his Acceptance of us, or Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in us. It is but Folly for them to pretend an Hope in his <hi>Mercy,</hi> who defie his <hi>Authority.</hi> And if (on the other hand) we so <hi>rest in them</hi> as to countenance our selves in any of the Evils mentioned, we shall succeed into their Room, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name and Pretence of the <hi>Church</hi> and its <hi>Priviledges</hi> fell into an open Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie from <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Gospel.</hi> For, the same Causes will produce the same Effect in us as they did in them. There is a <hi>Middle</hi> Way between these <hi>Extremes,</hi> which who so are guided into, will find Rest and Peace unto their Souls. And this is no other but an humble carefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Improvement of them all unto their proper Ends. And it may not be amiss to name some of those things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may know whether our Hearts are upright, and rightly disposed in the use of <hi>Gospel-Ordinances.</hi> And we may judge of our selves herein;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If our Hearts are Bettered by them,</hi>
                  <pb n="600" facs="tcp:204232:312"/>
                  <hi>or humbled for it if they are not.</hi> Their End with respect unto us, is to excite and put forth all Grace into Exercise. When therefore we find Faith and Love, Delight in God, longing after an Encrease of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Holiness;</hi> with a Detestation of <hi>Sin,</hi> Fruitfulness in <hi>good Works</hi> and all <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Obedience,</hi> Joy in <hi>spiritual things,</hi> Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abasement, and Admiration of <hi>Grace,</hi> stirred up in us by them; our Hearts need not Condemn us as to want of Sincerity in these Duties, though we are sensible of many Weaknesses and Imperfections. And whereas through the Power of <hi>Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Temptations,</hi> through the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and Prevalency of <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi> we come sometimes short of a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>Experience</hi> of this Effect on our Souls by and under them, there may yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a relieving Evidence of some <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> in what we doe. And this is, if rejecting all other Pretences and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, we charge our selves alone with our <hi>Ʋnprofitableness,</hi> and be humbled in a <hi>sense</hi> thereof. Want hereof hath been the Reason why some have <hi>rejected</hi> the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Gospel as <hi>dead and useless,</hi> and others have grown <hi>formal, careless</hi> and <hi>barren</hi> under the Enjoyment of them.
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:204232:312"/> When all Vails and Coverings shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away and destroyed, these things will appear to be the Fruits of <hi>Pride,</hi> and the Deceitfulness of Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is so when in the <hi>Dispensation</hi> of the Ordinances, <hi>spiritual things are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized and made nigh unto us.</hi> When in the Preaching of the Word we find Jesus Christ <hi>evidently set forth as crucified before our Eyes; Gal.</hi> 3. 1. When the <hi>form</hi> of the things delivered is brought upon our <hi>Minds, Rom.</hi> 6. 17. When we doe as it were <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>handle</hi> the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> and the things hoped for have some kind of <hi>subsistence</hi> given them in our Souls, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. then are we Exercised in a due manner in this part of our <hi>Obedience.</hi> To this purpose our Apostle discourseth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. The <hi>Word</hi> as preached and other Ordinances, do not direct us unto things <hi>afar off;</hi> but bring the Lord Christ with all the Benefits of his <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> into our <hi>Hearts.</hi> But if we content our selves with <hi>empty light,</hi> with unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Notions of <hi>spiritual things,</hi> if we rest satisfied with the <hi>outward Performance</hi> of our own Duty and that of other Men, we have just cause to fear that our Harts are
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:204232:313"/> not Right in the sight of God in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we find that a <hi>conscientious attendance</hi> on all the Ordinances of <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worship</hi> doth <hi>quicken our Diligence and Watchfulness unto all other Duties of Obedience that are required of us,</hi> we are conversant in them in a <hi>due manner.</hi> When under a <hi>pretence</hi> of them, and a mistaken <hi>satisfaction</hi> in them, men countenance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the <hi>Neglect</hi> of other Duties, how way is made for further Apostasie from <hi>Holiness,</hi> hath been declared. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no greater Evidence of our due Attendance unto them, than when we are excited, quickened, enlarged and confirmed by them, unto, and in all the wayes of <hi>universal Obedience.</hi> Those there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who most <hi>conscientiously</hi> make use of <hi>Church-Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Gospel-Ordinances,</hi> are they whose Hearts are most engaged unto all other Duties by them.</p>
               <p>Lastly; It is an Evidence of the same Importance when we have that <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of <hi>Christ and his Grace</hi> in the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration</hi> of <hi>Gospel-Ordinances</hi> according unto his Will, as that we are <hi>strengthened</hi> hereby to <hi>suffer for Him and them,</hi> when
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:204232:313"/> we are <hi>called</hi> thereunto. The Time will come when neither <hi>meer Light</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> nor the <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi> will secure men unto their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But he who hath <hi>tasted how Gracious</hi> Christ is in the Wayes of his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not easily be removed from his Resolution of <hi>following</hi> Him whitherever he goeth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; <hi>Take heed of the Infection of National Vices.</hi> What I intend thereby, hath been before declared. And this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is most necessary when they are most <hi>prevalent</hi> among any People. For <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> will take off a Sense of their <hi>Guilt,</hi> and <hi>Countenance</hi> will insensibly take away <hi>Shame.</hi> Besides, when some goe out unto an <hi>open Excess,</hi> others are apt to justifie themselves in vain <hi>Practices</hi> and sinful <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,</hi> because they rise not up unto the same height of Provocations with them. This makes lesser Vanities in Habits, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, Pleasures, Mispence of Time in <hi>Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houses,</hi> Excess in Eating and Drinking, corrupt Communication and careless Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in common Converses, whereby Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons tread in the Steps, and sometimes on the very Heels of the predominant Sins of
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:204232:314"/> the <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Age,</hi> so to abound among us. Some openly shew what they have a Mind to be at, if they durst; and that it is more <hi>Reputation</hi> and the Power of <hi>Convictions,</hi> than the Love of <hi>Gospel-Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> that restrains them from running forth into <hi>the same Excess of Riot</hi> with others. <hi>Israel</hi> of Old dwelt alone, and was not numbred among the Nations. And <hi>the Remnant of Jacob</hi> is to be so in <hi>the midst,</hi> in the <hi>bowels</hi> of many People, as to be a <hi>Blessing</hi> unto them, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. 8. not to be <hi>corrupted</hi> by them. If Professors will so immerse themselves into the Body of the People as insensibly to learn their <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> they will be carried down the stream with them into Perdition. And the <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> hereof is beyond what most men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Grace was but <hi>sparingly</hi> administred unto the Community of the People under the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> And therefore after Giving of the Law, God would not trust them to live among other People, nor other People to live among them, as knowing how unable they were to withstand the <hi>Temptations</hi> of <hi>Conformity</hi> unto them. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he appointed that all the Nations should be utterly <hi>extirpated</hi> where they were to
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:204232:314"/> inhabit, that <hi>they should not learn their Customs, Lev.</hi> 18. 30. The Neglect of this <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, the Transgression of his <hi>Will</hi> herein, by mixing themselves with other Nations, and learning their <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> was that which proved their <hi>Ruine.</hi> Under the Gospel there is a more <hi>plentifull Effusion</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> God now entrusts all that are called unto the <hi>Obedience</hi> of it, to live in the <hi>midst of all Nations</hi> under Heaven; Yet he so doth it, as to warn them of their <hi>Danger</hi> thereby, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to stand upon their <hi>Guard</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in continually. This is that part of <hi>true Religion</hi> which the Apostle <hi>James</hi> calls the <hi>keeping of our selves unspotted from the World,</hi> Chap. 1. 27. Most men think it enough, that no more can be required of them nor expected from them, than that they <hi>wallow not</hi> in the Mire and Pollutions of it. If their <hi>Practice</hi> be free from <hi>Actual open sins,</hi> they care not what <hi>spots</hi> of a <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conversation</hi> are upon them; but they know not what will be the End there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>It may be it will be said, that unless we do conform <hi>our selves</hi> in some things unto the <hi>Customs</hi> that are prevalent among
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:204232:315"/> us, as in <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Fashion,</hi> and way of <hi>Converse,</hi> we shall be despised in the World, and neither we nor ours be of any regard.</p>
               <p>I answer, (1) That I am not contending about <hi>small things,</hi> nor prescribing <hi>Modes of Attire,</hi> or Manner of <hi>Deportment</hi> unto any. There is none who doth more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the placing of Religion in <hi>Cloaths,</hi> in <hi>Gestures,</hi> in the Refusal of Civil and just <hi>Respects,</hi> than I doe; Nor have I any Severity in my Thoughts against a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> in these things among Persons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>Degrees</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> in the World, though apparently there be an <hi>Excess</hi> in all sorts herein. But that which I intend, is, a <hi>Complyance</hi> with the World in those things which <hi>border on,</hi> and make some kind of <hi>Representation</hi> of the predominant <hi>Vices</hi> of the <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Age</hi> wherein we live. And if you think you shall be <hi>despised</hi> if you come behind the rest of your Rank and Quality in the World in these things, still you will be so unless you come up unto them in all <hi>Abominations,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 34. and whether it be fit to relinquish <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> all <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> to have the <hi>Friendship of the World,</hi> judge
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:204232:315"/> ye. And, (2) Be sure to outgoe them in <hi>fixed Honesty, Kindness, Benignity, Ʋse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Meekness, Moderation of Spirit, Charity, Bowels of Compassion, Readiness to help and relieve all men</hi> according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Power, and you will quickly find, (even in this World,) how little you are concerned in that <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>vilest</hi> part of Mankind, whereof you seem to be afraid.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Carefully avoyd all those <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of Professors</hi> which <hi>alienate</hi> the <hi>Minds</hi> of men from the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi> them in the Contempt of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of it. Some of them we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, and many of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be added unto them. As the scandalous profligate <hi>Lives</hi> of those in General who are called <hi>Christians,</hi> gives that Offence unto <hi>Jews, Mahumetans</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> all the World over, that <hi>hardens</hi> them unto a Contempt and Detestation of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and hath brought the whole Matter of <hi>Religion</hi> in the World unto <hi>Force</hi> and the <hi>Sword;</hi> so the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of the <hi>strictest sort of Professors</hi> do greatly countenance others in their Dislike of, and Enmity against the <hi>power</hi>
                  <pb n="608" facs="tcp:204232:316"/> of <hi>Godliness,</hi> which they profess. And so far as we <hi>continue</hi> in them, we have a share in the Guilt of the present <hi>Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Not to insist on Particulars; the things of this Nature that are charged on them, may be reduced unto three Heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1) Want of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Ʋnity</hi> among themselves.</item>
                  <item>(2) Want of <hi>Ʋsefulness</hi> and <hi>Kindness</hi> towards all.</item>
                  <item>(3) <hi>Spiritual Pride</hi> and <hi>Censoriousness,</hi> or rash <hi>judging</hi> of other Men.</item>
               </list>
               <p>These are the things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly charged on some <hi>Professors.</hi> And although (it may be) they are but <hi>few</hi> who are guilty of all or any of these things, at least not as they are charged and <hi>reproached</hi> by others, yet they may all learn <hi>what</hi> in an especial manner to avoyd, that they give no Advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those who <hi>seek</hi> for it, and would be <hi>glad</hi> of it; It is our Duty by a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full holy Conversation in all things to <hi>put to silence the Ignorance of foolish men,</hi> and so universally to approve our <hi>Sincerity</hi> unto God and Men, that whereas we are, or may be at any time Evil-spoken of as <hi>Evil-doers,</hi> they may be <hi>ashamed,</hi>
                  <pb n="609" facs="tcp:204232:316"/> beholding our <hi>good Conversation</hi> in Christ, and <hi>glorifie</hi> God in the <hi>day of Visitation.</hi> This is the Law that we have brought our selves under, not to frett and fume, and in our Minds seek for <hi>Revenge,</hi> when we are traduced and Evil spoken of; but by a <hi>patient continuance in Well-doing,</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the Evil that the Malice of Hell or the World can cast upon us. And if we like not this <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> we had best Relinquish our <hi>Profession,</hi> for it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly required of all the Disciples of Jesus Christ. And he whose Heart is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Grace <hi>to doe well</hi> whilest he is <hi>Evil-spoken of,</hi> will find that present Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in a sense of his Acceptation with Christ, as to make him say, <hi>This Yoke is easie, and this Burden light.</hi> Especially ought we carefully to avoyd the things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and Appearances of them, whereby publick Offence is taken, and Advantage made by Evil men to countenance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their Sins. You are but <hi>few</hi> unto whom these things are communicated, and so may judge that all your Care in and about about them, will be of little signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy to put any stop unto the General <hi>Declension</hi> from <hi>Gospel-Holiness.</hi> But it is
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:204232:317"/> hoped that all others are warned in the same manner, yea and more effectually than you are; However, every Vessel must stand on its <hi>own bottom;</hi> the <hi>Just shall live</hi> by his <hi>own Faith;</hi> every <hi>one of us must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himself unto God,</hi> and no more is required of you but your own <hi>personal Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, you cannot put an End unto those <hi>Differences</hi> and <hi>Divisions,</hi> that Want of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> that is among <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.</hi> But you may take care that the <hi>Guilt</hi> of none of these things may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged on <hi>you.</hi> Love unto the Saints without Dissimulation, Readiness to bear in Meekness with different Apprehensions and palpable Misapprehensions, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching on the <hi>Foundation,</hi> freedom from Imposing your <hi>Sentiments</hi> on those who cannot receive them, and from <hi>judging rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> on supposed Failures, Readiness for <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Communion</hi> in all Religious Duties with all that <hi>love the Lord Jesus Christ in Sincerity;</hi> as they are our <hi>Duties,</hi> as they are some of the principal Wayes whereby we may truely Represent the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> and the Doctrine of the <hi>Gospel</hi> unto others; so they will <hi>disarm</hi> Sathan and the World
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:204232:317"/> of a <hi>great Engine</hi> whereby they work no small <hi>Mischief</hi> unto the whole <hi>Interest</hi> of Religion.</p>
               <p>Again; were all Professors <hi>meek, quiet, peaceable</hi> in their Societies and among their Neighbours, <hi>sober, temperate, humble</hi> in their personal Conversation in the World, <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, kind, benign, condescending</hi> towards all, <hi>chearfull</hi> in Trials and Afflictions, alwayes <hi>rejoycing in the Lord;</hi> Men not given up to a <hi>reprobate sense,</hi> (who are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,) would at length be so far from taking <hi>Offence</hi> at them, as to judge that they should not know what to doe <hi>without them,</hi> and be won to endeavour a <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> unto them. In like manner, were those <hi>Rules</hi> more diligently attended, which are prescribed unto all Believers, as unto their <hi>Conversation</hi> in this World, it would be of no small Advantage unto <hi>Religion.</hi> See <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12, 13. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. Did Honesty, Sincerity, Uprightness in all Occasions of Life, in the whole Converse of <hi>Professors</hi> in the World, shine more brightly, and give more <hi>Evidences</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves than at present among many they seem to doe, it would undoubtedly turn
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:204232:318"/> unto the unspeakable Advantage of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>And lastly, for that <hi>judging</hi> or <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others,</hi> wherewith they are so <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,</hi> there is but one way whereby it may be done, so as to give no just Offence; And this is in our <hi>Lives</hi> The Practice of <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> judgeth all <hi>unholy Persons</hi> in their own Breasts. And if they are <hi>provoked</hi> thereby, there is nothing in it but a <hi>new Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their own <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Impiety.</hi>
